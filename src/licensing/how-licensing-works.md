# Identify OutSystems infrastructure and runtime environments

You may subscribe to OutSystems Cloud or use a self-managed infrastructure. A typical infrastructure has several runtime environments like Development, Quality Assurance, and Production. LifeTime, the OutSystems management console also requires a dedicated environment.

Each OutSystems subscription has a unique [Activation Code](#activation-code) that identifies the infrastructure, which is the term used for the software running the development platform and the runtime environments that are licensed through your subscription. Each runtime environment has a unique [Serial Number](#serial-number) that identifies it.

## Frequently asked questions

### What is an Activation Code? { #activation-code }

An Activation Code is the unique identifier for an infrastructure. It has information about the configurations and features to which you've subscribed, such as:

* The number of users you can serve with your applications;

* The number of runtime environments within your infrastructure;

* The features available;

* The support level you have;

* The end date of your subscription.

Your Activation Code won't change regardless of any changes to your subscription. As an example, even if you acquire more runtime environments or change your support level, your Activation Code remains the same.

### What's a serial number, and how does it relate to an Activation Code? { #serial-number }

A Serial Number is a unique identifier of a runtime environment.

All your runtime environments have the same Activation Code, and each environment has a unique Serial Number. The Serial Number is hardware-based and automatically generated by the server assigned as controller of that environment.

### I have multiple servers within a runtime environment. Do I need multiple license files?

No you don't. OutSystems is designed for fault tolerance and horizontal scalability, so there isn't a limit on the number of servers within a given runtime environment.

### Where do I access my license files?

With the Activation Code of your infrastructure at hand you can download your license files from the [Customer portal](https://www.outsystems.com/licensing). Check [here](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Licensing/Manage_and_Upgrade/03_Get_a_license_file_for_an_environment) for the instructions on how to get and install a license file.
