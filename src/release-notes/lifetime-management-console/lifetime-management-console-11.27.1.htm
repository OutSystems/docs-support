<li>Fixed an issue in which the navigation from the Stagings_List screen, when clicking in the deployment plan label, for stagings that were created but not yet started was redirecting the user to the Staging_Progress screen. Now the navigation will redirect to most suitable screen according to the plan status. (R11CT-4120)</li>
