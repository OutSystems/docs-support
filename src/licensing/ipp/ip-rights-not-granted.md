# The IP rights of your applications could not be granted

In some cases, after submitting your application through the [IPP Portal](http://www.outsystems.com/IPP/), you get an email with the following message: _"The IP rights of your applications could not be granted"._

This means you're trying to change the activation code of an [application that is IPP-protected](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Licensing/Intellectual_Property_Protection_(IPP)). The infrastructure where that application was created doesn't allow applications to be published on the target infrastructure selected.

To solve this, please contact your OutSystems Platform administrator in order to make sure that IPP is properly setup. If this doesn't solve the issue, please [contact support](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support).
