# OS-MABS-SIG-40017

## Error message

`Signing settings require a manually managed profile, but your provisioning profile <provision_profile> is Xcode managed.`

## Cause

This error occurs when generating an iOS app and the provisioning profile file is an Xcode managed provisioning profile.

## Impact

Users can't generate the application package.

## Recommended action

Replace the Xcode managed provisioning profile for a manually created provisioning profile and retry.
