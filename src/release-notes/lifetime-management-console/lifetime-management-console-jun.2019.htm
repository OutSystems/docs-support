<li>Aborted deployment plans can now be easily retried. There's a new link in the deployment execution screen allowing you to create a new plan with the same applications and versions as the aborted plan. (RLIT-2696)</li>
<li>You can now refresh the applications in a deployment plan while the plan is being edited. This allows you to include new application changes done after plan creation, as well as having an up-to-date view on the environments and their applications and versions, without needing to recreate the deployment plan. (RLIT-2695)</li>

<ul>
<li>Using the option "Refresh Applications" in "Create Deployment Plan" screen may cause the deploy of the incorrect application versions. As a workaround, if you need to refresh the applications by this time, discard the deployment plan and create a new one. Fixed in LifeTime Management Console Release Sep.2019 CP1.</li>
