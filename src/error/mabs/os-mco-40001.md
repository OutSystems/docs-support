# OS-MCO-40001

## Error message

`A plugin in Extensibility Configurations is providing an empty source.`

## Cause

A plugin source in your extensibility configurations is empty and doesn't include an NPM package or a resource.

For example, using Universal Extensibility:

```json
{
  "buildConfigurations": {
    "capacitor": {
      "source": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Another example, using Cordova-based Extensibility:

```json
{
  "plugin": {}
}
```

## Impact

The mobile compilation fails, causing the native mobile build to fail.

## Recommended action

Find the plugin with the empty source in your extensibility configurations and update it to include a valid NPM package or resource. Alternatively, you can remove the relevant extensibility properties or remove the library from your mobile app.

If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-MCO-40001).
