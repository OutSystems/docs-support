# Curating Projects

## What is a Supported project? { #supported }

An OutSystems Supported project is a component or application that's developed, maintained, and supported by OutSystems under the terms of a customer's subscription. Supported components are distributed in two different ways:

* As an open repository, allowing customers to change them for their own needs. However, once a customer has changed them, such components will no longer be supported by OutSystems.

* As a closed component that doesnâ€™t allow customization. As part of the product, these components are under intellectual property protection.

## What is a Trusted project? { #trusted }

A trusted project is a component that has been validated by the OutSystems Curation Team. This ensures the component delivers the promised functionality and that it was built based on best practices for security, documentation and code quality. Trusted components are supported by the Community.

You can find the detailed requirements to trust a component in the [Trusted components requirements](trusted-requirements.md).

## What is a Featured project? { #featured }

A featured project is a component or application, not necessarily developed by OutSystems, that we believe offers customers valuable functionality or content.

## What is a Deprecated project? { #deprecated }

A deprecated project is a component or application that's no longer suitable or recommended for download. Most likely, this is because another project with equivalent functionality has replaced it.

## How do I get support for a specific project? { #get-support }

Customers with an active OutSystems subscription can submit a request via the [OutSystems Support Portal](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support) for supported projects.

Community support is available for other projects. Browse to the Discussions tab on the project's page and review the existing answers. If you don't find what you're looking for, start a new thread.

## How to remove a component from the Forge? { #remove-component }

For reasons related to security and intellectual property protection (IPP), users cannot remove their components from the Forge on their own. However, the owner of a component in Forge can request its removal. See [How to remove a component from the Forge](remove-project.md) for further details.
