<li>We have updated the Analytics Console to provide deeper insights into your user base. The "Users" metric, which previously combined all traffic, is now split into two distinct metrics: Authenticated and Anonymous users. This granular breakdown is available on the Overview page and across the Users, Geography, and Browser widgets on the Asset page, giving you a clearer view of who is interacting with your applications.
