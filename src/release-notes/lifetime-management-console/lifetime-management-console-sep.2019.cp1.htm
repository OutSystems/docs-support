<ul>
<li>Using the option "Refresh Applications" in "Create Deployment Plan" screen may not include new modules or remove deleted modules when using Tag and Deploy options. As a workaround, if you need to refresh the applications by this time because there are new modules or modules were removed, discard the deployment plan and create a new one.</li>
</ul>
