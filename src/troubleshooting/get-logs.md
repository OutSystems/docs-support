# How to get logs for troubleshooting purposes

This article explains how to get the logs and report files from the several OutSystems components and other system components.

In context of a support case, OutSystems Support might require that you provide some of these files so they can troubleshoot the issues you are experiencing. In this situation, you should get the required files as described in this article and attach them to your support case.

## Service Studio Report

When an **unexpected error** occurs in Service Studio, you will get an Unexpected Error window. The Service Studio report has all the actions performed inside Service studio within an active session as well as all unhandled exceptions.

Click the accordion below to learn how to get the Service Studio report.

    <div class="os-accordion__title" style="font-size:100%" markdown="1">
    Get Service Studio Report
    </div>
<div class="os-accordion__content" markdown="1">

1. Click **You can help us fix this…** to expand the window, if it’s not expanded.

1. Click **View diagnostics report** to open the report in a text editor. In OutSystems 10, use the link **View report**.

    ![](images/get-logs-2.png?width=600)

1. Save the report as a text file. If you need help from OutSystems support but you don’t have an open support case yet, you can use the link **open a support case** to go to Support Portal.
1. Click **Continue** to close the window. In OutSystems 10, use **Cancel**.

## Service Center Logs

### Runtime Logs

The [logs for the runtime of the platform](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Managing_the_Applications_Lifecycle/Monitor_and_Troubleshoot/View_the_Environment_Logs_and_Status#monitoring-area) are available in the **Service Center** console of each environment - application and LifeTime environments. These logs can be helpful when trying to debug a specific feature or behavior and understanding exactly what is happening within that process. You can access the following reports from Service Center:

* Errors
* General logs
* Web requests
* Mobile requests
* Service Actions
* Integrations
* Extensions
* Timers
* Emails

Click the accordion below to learn how to get Runtime logs.

    <div class="os-accordion__title" style="font-size:100%" markdown="1">
    Get Runtime Logs
    </div>
<div class="os-accordion__content" markdown="1">

1. In the Service Center console of the environment you want to obtain the logs from (`https://<your_server>/ServiceCenter`), go to the **Monitoring** section.

1. Choose the type of logs you want to get (e.g., **Errors** or **General**).

## Platform Solution File 

A Platform Solution is a list of all modules and dependencies related to a certain application that make up all the application’s content and references. Having a full solution for an application helps us understand how each element works with all its other dependencies. This makes sure that no connection is broken between each module and works properly.

## Platform Service Logs 

The Service logs are the logs for the OutSystems services, such as the Scheduler or the Deployment service. These logs help us understand in more detail what is happening within the OutSystems services actions and logic being run during normal operations, such as running timers, compiling modules or synchronizing environments. [Click here](`https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Troubleshooting/Application_lifecycle/Change_OutSystems_platform_logging_levels_-_OSTrace`) to read more about Platform Logs. 


## Database - AWR and ADDM Report

The AWR and ADDM report are database reports detailing important information about the performance of the database. 

ADDM automatically detects and reports on performance problems with the database, such as:

* Adding CPUs or changing the I/O subsystem configuration
* Changing initialization parameter settings
* Hash partitioning a table or index, or using automatic segment-space management (ASSM)
* Using the cache option for sequences or using bind variables
* Running the SQL Tuning Advisor on high-load SQL statements or running the Segment Advisor on hot objects

AWR has valuable information such as:
* CPU Statistics
* Wait Time Statistics
* Workload Profile
* Sessions

[Click here](`https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/TGDBA/compare_stats.htm#TGDBA272`) to learn how to get AWR reports.
