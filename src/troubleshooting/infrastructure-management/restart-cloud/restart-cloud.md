# Restart services on OutSystems Cloud

## Overview

Should any issues with OutSystems services arise on a cloud environment, you can check the related errors and:

* Retry synchronization to see if it's just a communication issue.
* Restart the OutSystems services in case they got stuck.

This option isn't available in Personal Environments.

## Resolution

On 1 you can check the detail of the error and on 2 you can have some more details about that environment:

On the error report, you can try to sync your environment again just to see if this was just a communication problem. If it doesn't resolve the issue, then you can go to the environment details and restart OutSystems services:

Clicking **Restart Services** performs an IIS reset, clears the application pools, and restarts all OutSystems Services (OutSystems Deployment Controller Service, OutSystems Deployment Service, OutSystems Scheduler Service) and clears any hanging requests. If there's a timeout restarting the OutSystems Services, the front-end is restarted instead. In the case of multiple front-ends, any restart is balanced (front-end servers are restarted one at a time).
