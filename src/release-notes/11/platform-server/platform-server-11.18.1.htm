<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>When clicking Save at the Environment Security page in Service Center (Administration > Security), a warning to "Save and Apply Settings to the Factory" may wrongly appear.  For example, if you have only changed the "Enhanced security for Remoting requests", the message to "Save and Apply Settings to the Factory" may appear but it's not necessary to apply settings.
This will happen when the default values for  Secure and SameSite Cookies are used.</li>
