# Protecting OutSystems apps using encryption and SSL/TLS

By using encryption you safeguard stored, or in transit, sensitive data from being read by third-parties. However, the most common flaw in software is not encrypting sensitive data.

Usually, attackers donâ€™t attempt to break the encryption itself, they break something else. Some examples of attack vectors are stealing plain text data, using Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, or stealing keys.

The following example illustrates how a MITM attack can be used to listen to a communication between two computers and impersonate a legitimate user after stealing their session (green arrows represent secure connections, while red arrows represent plain text connections):

## How to do it with OutSystems

OutSystems encrypts all the stored data of Cloud customers automatically. For customers with on-premise environments, the recommended strategy is to **encrypt all channels and sensitive data**.
To do so with OutSystems Platform follow these recommendations for each scenario:

|**Use case** |**Actions** |
|-------------|------------|
|Secure apps' communications |**HTTPS, SSL/TLS**: Use [HTTP Security SSL](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Developing_an_Application/Secure_the_Application/Secure_HTTP_Requests) in Web Flows and Web Services (Requires SSL certificate).  Use only trusted SSL certificates. |
|Protect how Cookies are transmitted |**HTTPS, HSTS**: Enable secure cookies in your applications/server. Enable [HSTS](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) headers (forced HTTPS at the client-side - see [Enforce HTTPS Security](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Managing_the_Applications_Lifecycle/Secure_the_Applications/Enforce_HTTPS_Security).) |
|Encrypt data (stored or in transit) | **AES-128, AES-256**:OutSystems hashes the built in [end users](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Developing_an_Application/Secure_the_Application/End_User_Management) and [IT users](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Managing_the_Applications_Lifecycle/Manage_IT_Users) passwords with a salted SHA512 algorithm. Use [CryptoAPI](http://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-details/437/CryptoAPI/) component to encrypt your data. Use a Key Management System. Use [OutSystems Platform built-in SHA512 algorithms for hashing](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_APIs/PlatformPasswordUtils_API). |
