<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue causing some IT users to be redirected to the old experience after being associated with the Architecture Dashboard. (RADRT-1650)</li>
<li>Exporting the findings report to Excel no longer causes an Invalid Parameters error when the selected language is not English. (RADRT-1718)</li>

This could lead to a "This fact has already been resolved by a different user" error message if you tried to set these findings to a "Resolved" status. (RPM-1884)</li>
</ul>
