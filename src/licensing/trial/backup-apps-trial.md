# Backing up and continuing work on your apps at the end of the trial

Even though you are at the end of your trial, you can continue working for free using a Personal Environment.

Alternatively, you can keep full access to OutSystems products with a subscription. [Contact us](https://outsystems.drift.click/book-a-meeting) to set up a meeting and learn more.

**Important:**

* You must have an environment to access the platform, and to edit and deploy your apps.
* The apps you create during the trial are only available for download for 6 months from the end of your trial.
* You are only backing up your apps. Your data isn't recoverable.

Follow these steps to create your Personal Environment when your trial ends, then download and upload your apps, and continue your work.
