<h3>New in Integration Builder 1.30</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improvement on the Sharepoint Search Server Action. A new structure was added, as an input parameter, to filter by folder and also include/exclude sub-folders files. (RCNT-4219)</li>
<li>Added support for relational database integrations when each environment has a different catalog. In the "Select database" step of the wizard, there is a new option "Connection's default database". When this option is selected, the default database that was input when the external database connection was created will be used by the connector. This allows you to have different default databases per environment. (RCNT-4372)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integration Builder doesn't prompt users to update dependencies that don't affect integrations published to the customer's environment anymore. (RCNT-4490)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused errors when generating an SAP OData connector and the request structure contains sub-structures. (RCNT-4506)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Integration Builder to update integrations that weren't selected on the Settings page. (RCNT-4526)</li>
</ul>
