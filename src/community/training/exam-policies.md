# OutSystems exams scheduling, cancelation and refund policies

OutSystems exam candidates accept the reschedule and cancelation terms and conditions during the registration process:

**The period in which it is possible to reschedule exams and associated fees:**
To be able to reschedule exams, candidates need to do it up to 15 days before the exam’s original scheduled date and time. Rescheduling the exam 14 days ahead of its date, and up to 48 hours ahead, will incur an extra fee of 25 US$. It's impossible to reschedule the exam less than 48 hours before the date, so be sure to do it, if you wish, before that.

**For rescheduling or canceling candidates are asked for 4 characters of their last name as well as the confirmation number:** 
By default, all candidates will have their user login automatically created with their last name with 4 letters, but since this is up to 4, anyone with 2 or 3 characters will be able to use the 3 letters' last name characters and proceed.

**How to get a refund for a canceled exam:**
To be able to get a refund when canceling the exam, candidates need to cancel it up to 15 days before the exam’s original scheduled date and time. In case candidates cancel the exam within less than 15 days before the exam date, the refund won't be processed.

**Where to reschedule or cancel an exam:**
Candidates with a scheduled exam can reschedule by accessing the [Certification Page](https://www.outsystems.com/learn/certifications/), selecting the scheduled exam and clicking the Reschedule or Cancel button, following the steps.

**Candidates now showing up on the exam’s scheduled date and time:**
In case the candidate doesn't show up for a scheduled exam, it won't be possible for them to have access to it after that date, since the exam will then become expired. The session is now lost, without being able to get rescheduled.
