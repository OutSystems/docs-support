# How to free up an existing environment in licensing

This article explains how you can release an environment serial number in the [Customer Portal](https://www.outsystems.com/licensing/), which may be necessary when performing the following operations:

* upgrade the OutSystems Platform Server; 

* transfer an OutSystems environment across servers;

* change server hardware;

* sunset an existing OutSystems environment.

On any of these operations, it's possible that the serial number of the environment changes. If that's the case, you'll need to release the serial number associated with the environment and register a new one. Once you've done that, you can download an updated license file.
