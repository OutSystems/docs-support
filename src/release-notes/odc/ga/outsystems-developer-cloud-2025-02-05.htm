<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the User Entity from the System producer not to be pickable when trying to add it in the preview step of Mentor. Now, the User Entity can be picked and used to generate applications with Mentor. (RDMAG-594)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Mentor to fail when generating applications.
This occurred when the user provided prompts and/or requirement documents that included characters with diacritics.
Now, Mentor is more robust and is able to generate applications even when these characters are present. (RDMAG-608)</li>
</ul>
