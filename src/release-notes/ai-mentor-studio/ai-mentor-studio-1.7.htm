Using artificial intelligence, Architecture Dashboard finds logic patterns that are repeated in different action flows across your environment. Use this information to guide your refactoring and reduce maintenance costs. You can change the state of duplicated code findings the same way you do for other findings. (RADRT-1107)</li>
