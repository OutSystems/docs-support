<ul>

<li>Added support for REDIS 8.2.2 (or higher, within the 8.2 line) as the session database for on-premise customers. (R11BRT-2136)</li>

<h3 id="bug_fixing_platform_server_11.39.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused DBCleaner_API's Attribute_ListDeleted to return attributes when they were in use after renames. (R11BRT-2027)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Server.API that caused slowness in some endpoints related to Entities. (R11BRT-2037)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused false positives in the detection of breaking changes of processes during a publication. 
This occurred when the processes had a loop pattern.
Created a new algorithm to reduce the number of false positives. This algorithm has a performance impact and can be enabled via Factory Configuration. (RPM-6022) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span>  <span class="cattag">Impact Analysis</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Service Center would fail to call the compiler service due to a cached telemetry initialization error. (RPM-6035) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span>  <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> </li>
</ul>
