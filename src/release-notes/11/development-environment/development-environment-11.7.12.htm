<ul>
<li>Avoid doing unnecessary requests when native tab of Application details is not opened (RMAC-2953)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_11.7.12">Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed solution publish error when compiling dependencies (not refreshed) to a structure that has new attributes with complex types (RSBO-1521)</li>
<li>We fixed a glitch in the launch of the debugger from Reactive Apps. The Chrome window for debugging now opens in a desktop mode, without resizing to the mobile form factor. (RTAF-2996)</li>
<li>Fix error when deleting object with editor dialog open (RMAC-2822)</li>
<li>We fixed a publishing error by improving the scope of widgets inside Placeholders. You still can reference, from widgets inside Placeholders, the elements that are in Blocks/Screens. However, you can't, from Blocks/Screens/Client Actions, reference the elements that are inside Placeholders. The invalid referencing broke the publishing step and caused a generic "object not found" error. (RTAF-2889)</li>
</ul>
