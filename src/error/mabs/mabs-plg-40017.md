# OS-MABS-PLG-40017

## Error message

`Couldn't install the Cordova plugin <plugin_name> because the plugin
dependency <plugin_dependency> doesn't support this Cordova version.`

## Cause

This error occurs when the plugin **&lt;plugin_name&gt;** has a dependency declared
which is incompatible with the Cordova version (or Cordova platform version)
this MABS version is using.

## Impact

Users can't generate the application package.

## Recommended action

Check the build logs on Service Center and fix the plugin dependency to match
the Cordova version or change the MABS version to a version compatible with the
plugin. Then, try to generate your application again.

You can check the [release
notes](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/Mobile_Apps_Build_Service_Versions)
page of the MABS version you are using to validate the versions for Cordova CLI
or Cordova engine (android/ios).
