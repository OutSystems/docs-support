<h2 id="integration_builder_1.34.0">Integration Builder 1.34.0</h2>
<div class="info"><p>Released on May 05, 2022</p></div>
<h3 id="new_in_integration_builder_1.34.0">New in Integration Builder 1.34.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a hint to help fill port information on relational database connections. (RCNT-4701)</li>
<li>MongoDB integrations just got easier with the new version of the MongoDB connector. Now, collections can be represented in structure format, meaning Integration Builder inspects the collection schema and generates Structures. You can still choose to use the JSON output format. MongoDB integrations are available exclusively in the latest version of Integration Builder and are fully supported by OutSystems. Find out more about MongoDB integrations in <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/goto/ib-mongodb-docs">our documentation</a>. (RCNT-4854)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_1.34.0">Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused invalid connections to show in Integration Manager after deleting and then reinstalling an Integration Manager plugin. Now, when you delete a plugin, the connections that use that plugin are deleted. (RCNT-4731)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused MongoDB integrations to show a "Pending changes" warning even after the integrations are published. (RCNT-4794)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that allowed users to attempt republishing integrations while the dependency update process was running, causing concurrency errors. (RCNT-4809)</li>
</ul>
