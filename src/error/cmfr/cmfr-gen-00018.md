## Error message

`You can only have one initial case status.`

## Cause

While executing one of the **Bootstrap/Setup** actions, the Case Management framework detected that more than one case status record had its **IsInitial** attribute set as **True**. There can only be one case status set as initial for each case definition.

## Impact

The Case Management framework wasn't able to successfully execute the action.

## Recommended action

Make sure that only one of the case status records has its **IsInitial** attribute set as **True**.
