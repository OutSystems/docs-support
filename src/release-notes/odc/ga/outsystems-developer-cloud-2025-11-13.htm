<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue when building Capacitor apps, related to a breaking release by Rollup. (RDMR-1070)</li>
<li>Triggering validations on forms with multiple layers of nested blocks inside them now properly validates all nested widgets, including those bellow two or more layers of nesting. (RPM-6260)</li>
<li>Using a Static Entity Identifier as a default attribute in a structure imported from another application no longer results in invalid model code being generated which would break the application. (RPM-6267)</li>
</ul>
