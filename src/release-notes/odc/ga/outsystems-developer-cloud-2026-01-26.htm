<ul>
<li>[Mentor AppGen]<br/>
&lt;ul&gt;<br/>
&lt;li&gt; Added support for a new Accordion UI pattern in List Screens. You can now use expandable list items to organize content more efficiently in your mobile and web applications.&lt;/li&gt;<br/>
&lt;li&gt;You can now use Expand and Collapse functionality for filters. This improvement helps optimize screen real estate by allowing users to hide filter options when they are not in use.&lt;/li&gt;<br/>
&lt;li&gt;Mentor now supports inline editing within these Master-Detail views, allowing you to update records without losing the list context, significantly improving operational efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;<br/>
&lt;/ul&gt; (RDMOR-3184)</li>

<ul>
<li>[Mentor AppGen]<br/>
&lt;ul&gt;<br/>
&lt;li&gt; Fixed an issue where imported entities would not persist in the application model after the preview step. (<a href="/browse/RDMOR-3076" title="Imported entity does not stay on app after generation [conversational]" class="issue-link" data-issue-key="RDMOR-3076"><strike>RDMOR-3076</strike></a>)&lt;/li&gt;<br/>
&lt;li&gt; Fixed an OML generation error that occurred during the creation of the Icons Dictionary. This issue was preventing the final application binary from being generated when specific icon sets were used.(<a href="/browse/RDMOR-3004" title="Verify SRC.O.06 - Telemetry cost optimization" class="issue-link" data-issue-key="RDMOR-3004">RDMOR-3004</a>).&lt;/li&gt;<br/>
&lt;li&gt; Resolved an OML generation error that happened when an application specification lacked a List or Dashboard screen. Mentor now correctly generates valid application files even for simplified app specs.(<a href="/browse/RDMOR-2996" title="Add log messages with retrieved context for debugging" class="issue-link" data-issue-key="RDMOR-2996"><strike>RDMOR-2996</strike></a>)&lt;/li&gt;<br/>
&lt;li&gt; Fixed an issue where Mentor failed to suggest external entities even when explicitly requested by the user during the chat. Entity suggestion logic has been fine-tuned for better alignment with user intent.(<a href="/browse/RDMOR-3045" title="Auto-retry GenerateApp call on timeout" class="issue-link" data-issue-key="RDMOR-3045">RDMOR-3045</a>)&lt;/li&gt;<br/>
&lt;li&gt; Resolved a crash in app generation triggered by excessively long action names. AppGen now supports standard length constraints for all generated actions.(<a href="/browse/RDMOR-3033" title="Agent blueprint with a final UX" class="issue-link" data-issue-key="RDMOR-3033">RDMOR-3033</a>)&lt;/li&gt;<br/>
&lt;li&gt;Fixed a bug where Mentor was unable to locate external database connections during the initial app setup. Connection discovery is now more reliable.(<a href="/browse/RDMOR-3011" title="Null EditSection in ListPopupSection" class="issue-link" data-issue-key="RDMOR-3011">RDMOR-3011</a>)&lt;/li&gt;<br/>
&lt;/ul&gt; (RDMOR-3187)</li>
</ul>
