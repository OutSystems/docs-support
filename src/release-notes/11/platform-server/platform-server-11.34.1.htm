<ul>
<li>The OutSystems Platform no longer reports that it is using JQuery-ui and JQuery-ui-dialog version 1.8.24. 
OutSystems ships a custom fork of jQuery UI 1.8.24 with back-ported fixes for all known vulnerabilities. Previously, the platform reported this fork as version 1.8.24, which led to false positives in security scans.
If your application logic relies on detecting the 1.8.24 version string, it may no longer behave as expected. This is not a supported use case and should be avoided. (R11DT-3109)</li>
