<h3>Breaking Change</h3>
<ul>
<li>The title of the Popup_Editor, Popup_EditorForUpload, and Popup_EditorVanilla is now encoded to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This may cause it to appear garbled in very specific scenarios.<br/>
Check <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Archive/11/OutSystems_Platform_side_effects_and_breaking_changes" rel="internal">OutSystems 11 side effects and breaking changes</a> for more details on the breaking change and a possible workaround. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>This Platform Server version introduces an issue where factories with more than 1000 application permissions have their IT users losing permissions over the applications of an environment. This issue was introduced with Platform Server 11.14.0 and has been mitigated in Platform Server 11.16.0.</li>

<b>Fixed an issue that was blocking the activation/deactivation of Timers in cloned modules.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
When trying to Activate/Deactivate a Timer of a module in the Service Center console, the operation has no effect and the NextRun value remains unchanged, although the feedback message confirms the change. This issue occurred only for modules that were cloned from modules with Timers.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-1118"><strong>RPM-1118</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed an issue that could cause incorrect code generation for SQL nodes with expand inline parameters in Oracle databases, after upgrading the Platform Server component to 11.12.0 or later.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
When upgrading an environment using an Oracle database to Platform Server 11.12.0 or later, the System Components installation failed with an HTTP NotFound error. After that, when trying to open the Service Center console, you would get ORA-00903 and ORA-00936 errors. Any use of expand inline parameters in SQL nodes would result in application errors. This issue only happened in some specific scenarios.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-1125"><strong>RPM-1125</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed an issue that could cause modules to have outdated dependencies after a Platform Server upgrade.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Service Studio</span> <span class="cattag">References</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
After upgrading from a Platform Server version prior to 11.10.0 to Platform Server 11.10.0 or later, performing the Apply Settings operation before republishing the applications would cause modules with renamed or deleted Site Properties to be outdated. This issue could cause the application to be unavailable.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-1177"><strong>RPM-1177</strong></a><br/>
<b>The Roles screen of the Users application is now correctly listing only the end users having that role.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> <span class="cattag">Users</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
In the Users application, when selecting a specific Role to see its details, you should see the list of end-users with that role. Instead, the screen listed all end-users in the environment.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-1190"><strong>RPM-1190</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed an issue that could cause incorrect code generation for SQL nodes with expand inline parameters in SQL Server databases, after upgrading the Platform Server component to 11.12.0 or later.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
When upgrading an environment using a SQL Server database to Platform Server 11.12.0 or later, the System Components installation failed with an HTTP InternalServerError. After that, when trying to open the Service Center console, you would get query execution errors. Any use of expand inline parameters in SQL nodes would result in application errors. This issue only happened in some specific scenarios.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-1198"><strong>RPM-1198</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed an error when publishing the System Components solution during the upgrade to Platform Server 11.12.0 or later caused by producer modules not being prepared.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
When upgrading the Platform Server component to version 11.12.0 or later, publishing the System Components fails with the error "Old Producer: Producer module 'EnterpriseManager' hasn't been prepared for the the current OutSystems environment version".
This error occurred only while upgrading environments that were originally created with very early Platform Server versions, having the effective User Provider of the Users module set to the Enterprise Manager deprecated module. As the Enterprise Manager module is not included in the solution anymore, the publishing failed.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-1260"><strong>RPM-1260</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed an issue that prevented Timers, Emails, and Processes from running after changing the name of the Server.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Processes</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
When changing the name of a registered front-end Server, a new Server record is automatically registered in the Service Center console after restarting the OutSystems Deployment service. This operation was lacking the update of the Timers, Processes, and Emails executed by that Server to reference the new record. This issue has been solved, and all references are now updated to match the new Server record when the Server name changes.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-1272"><strong>RPM-1272</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed the "Unable to find the specified file" error when publishing the System Components solution during a Platform Server upgrade.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
When publishing the System Components solution during a Platform Server upgrade, the following error is thrown for each module of the solution: "An error occurred in task 'Building Oml with Empty Proxies for espace [module_name]': Unable to find the specified file". This issue would happen because the user associated with the OutSystems Deployment Controller service lacked the permissions to create symbolic links.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-1296"><strong>RPM-1296</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed an issue that could cause a timeout when publishing the Service Center component through the Configuration Tool using an Oracle database.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
For some specific Oracle versions, the database engine is not choosing the most efficient plan to execute a specific query that runs during the compilation phase when using the default IntrospectionMethod key value defined in the Server.hsconf file. This was causing a timeout when publishing the Service Center component through the Configuration Tool.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-1325"><strong>RPM-1325</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed an error when publishing the Service Center component during a Platform Server installation or upgrade using an Oracle database. This error occurred only when the user OSADMIN had no permissions to execute the DBMS_RANDOM Oracle package.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
While installing or upgrading the Platform Server in environments using an Oracle database, the publishing of the Service Center component failed with a "Could not create foreign key constraint." error. The issue only occurred in environments where the DBMS_RANDOM Oracle package was removed from the Public user group, resulting in the lack of permissions for the user OSADMIN to execute that package.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-1374"><strong>RPM-1374</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed the "Error getting publication state" error when publishing the System Components solution during a Platform Server upgrade.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
When upgrading the Platform Server component, publishing the System Components failed with the error "Error getting publication state". This was an issue when the Configuration Tool retrieves information from the Server.API and it's now fixed. 
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-1420"><strong>RPM-1420</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed application deployment issues when Dynatrace was enabled in the environment.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <span class="cattag">Deployment stage</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
The Dynatrace tool injects customized code in some platform internal files, causing the OutSystems Deployment service to fail the integrity check after publishing a module. Having this tool enabled prompted the OutSystems Deployment service into error state and application deployments to fail with the error "Deployment failed: Ping validation failed".
</p>

<a id="RPM-1421"><strong>RPM-1421</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed an issue that led to 404 Traditional Web app screens using an SEO Page Rule that started with "rest".</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">SEO Friendly URLs</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
The issue led to a 404 when accessing screens that used an SEO Page Rule.
This issue occurred when using Platform Server version 11.12.1 or later and affected Traditional Web app screens using SEO Page Rule with a URL Pattern that started with "rest".

<b>Updated the installation checklist instructions for integration with IBM Db2 databases.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Installation Checklist</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
In environments with integration with IBM Db2 databases, attempting to access the Db2 database after installing the Platform Server resulted in the error “The ConnectionString property is invalid“, with error stack “Unable to load DLL ‘cwbdc.dll’". This happens because IBM i Access for Windows has been replaced by IBM iAccess Client Solutions (ACS), therefore the required file "cwbdc.dll" is not installed anymore when following the previous installation checklist instructions. The checklist was updated to provide the correct instructions for integration with IBM Db2 databases.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-1522"><strong>RPM-1522</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed the error "ORA-01489: result of string concatenation is too long" when publishing a module with an Action which description exceeds 4000 bytes. This issue occurred only in Oracle databases.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
Starting from Platform Server 11.0.422.0, the Action's description is saved in the database with a limit of 2000 characters, which represents a maximum of 4000 bytes in Oracle databases. This issue occurred when the description of an Action had less than 2000 characters, but more than 4000 bytes, which can happen, for example, for Japanese characters. In this scenario, publishing the module resulted in the error "ORA-01489: result of string concatenation is too long".

<b>Fixed an issue that caused third-party components that used click events to not work as expected in PWA Mobile apps.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Interface</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
The issue caused third-party components that used click events to not work as expected.
This occurred in Mobile apps distributed as PWAs.
The issue no longer occurs after the removal of the FastClick.js  from Mobile apps.

<b>The Configuration Tool no longer proceeds with the Apply and Exit operation if the Platform Administrator password is empty.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
In environments using Windows Authentication, when you open the Configuration Tool the passwords are empty, which is the expected behavior. However, when clicking the Apply and Exit button, the Configuration Tool would execute the apply operation and attempt to connect with the database. In some cases, the failed login attempt to the database could lock the account.

<p>
<a id="RPM-1575"><strong>RPM-1575</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed the Test Connection validation in the Configuration Tool when using Windows Authentication.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br/>
<br/>

<b>The Platform Server installer no longer installs .Net Core 2.1.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span> <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
As of Platform Server 11.12.2, the installer will only install .NET Core 3.1 Runtime & Hosting Bundle for Windows, which is part of the system requirements.
Although it replaces .NET Core 2.1 which is no longer supported, the installer does not remove it. If you previously had .NET Core 2.1 installed and remove it, this will break the .NET Core 3.1 installation and can as well cause some OutSystems services to fail.
With that said, the installer of Platform Server 11.13.0 or later installed both versions.
Please note that if you want to remove .NET Core 2.1, the correct procedure is to remove both versions, and install only .NET Core 3.1.
From version 11.14 and later this issue was fixed.

<b>Fixed the "c is not a function" runtime error occurring on some occasions for Reactive Web Apps and Mobile Apps distributed as a PWA after a Platform Server upgrade.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
After upgrading from a Platform Server version prior to 11.12.0 to Platform Server 11.12.0 or later, the runtime error "c is not a function" would sometimes occur for Reactive Web Apps and Mobile Apps distributed as a PWA. This issue was related to the Modified Date of the Client Runtime resources, which is <a href= "https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/20439"> set by the npm package manager</a> with the same pre-defined date for any client runtime bundle. This was preventing IIS to detect the need to update the cache, serving old client runtime bundles instead.
