After you reset your password, allow for 3 minutes before trying to sign in again to your Personal Environment. This is necessary for the password from the community profile to sync with your Personal Environment.

After unsuccessful attempts to sign in, your account may be blocked for 1 hour. The lock remains even after you reset your password.
