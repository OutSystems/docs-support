# OS-MCO-40014

## Error message

`The library <AssetName> does not support the mobile framework <MobileFramework>.`

## Cause

The mobile library that wraps the mobile plugin does not support the specified mobile framework.

## Impact

The mobile compilation fails, causing the native mobile build to fail.

## Recommended action

Take one of the following actions based on your situation:

**If you developed the mobile library**, update it to support both Cordova and Capacitor frameworks. For more information, refer to [Implement a dual-stack plugin](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/building_apps/mobile_apps/use_mobile_plugins/implement_a_dual_stack_plugin/).

**If you're using a third-party mobile library**, try one of the following:

1. Update the asset to the latest version. Newer versions are more likely to support both mobile frameworks.
1. Find an alternative mobile library that supports your required mobile framework.
1. Build your mobile app using the mobile framework that the library supports.

If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-MCO-40014).
