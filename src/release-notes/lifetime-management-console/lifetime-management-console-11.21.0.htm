<h3 id="new_in_lifetime_management_console_11.21.0" >New in LifeTime Management Console 11.21.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to create and edit multiple deployment plans for the same target environment in parallel. This can be done using both the LifeTime UI and the LifeTime API. Available for all infrastructures: OutSystems Cloud, hybrid, and self-managed. (R11CT-2730)</li>
<li>It is now possible, for OutSystems Cloud, to execute in parallel multiple deployment plans that target a single environment. This capability will become available to self-managed infrastructures in a subsequent LifeTime release. (R11CT-2731)</li>
<li>The Platform Server version bundled with LifeTime was upgraded to 11.25.0. (R11CT-2777)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_lifetime_management_console_11.21.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in the LifeTime API ‘POST /deployments/{DeploymentKey}/{Command}/' endpoint that caused error details to be omitted when returning an invalid request status. Now, this endpoint has a new optional input parameter called "IncludeErrorDetails", which, when set to ‘True’, will change the error message to include more information, when such is available. The default value of the "IncludeErrorDetails" parameter is 'False', which makes the API behave as it did in older LifeTime versions. Note that in a future release of LifeTime the default value of this new parameter will be changed to 'True’ which may cause breaking changes for consumers that expect specific error messages from this endpoint. (R11CT-2710)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the LifeTime installation checklist that was missing relevant information for the scenarios of 'Upgrade to a new Major Release' and 'Upgrade to a new Release or Cumulative Patch'.  (R11CT-2737)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where only 7 characters were allowed in the application tag. Now, applications can be tagged as before, as well as in any variation of the following format: ###.###.###. Suggestion made by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/profile/jppqqjaygb/overview">Dekkinga</a>. (RPM-1283) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused "Authentication failed" with a 403 status code when calling the LifeTime API v2. This occurred when the infrastructure had a SSL offload configuration and the forwarded requests were made with HTTP instead of HTTPS. (RPM-3782) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the LifeTimeAPI that affected the retrieval of environment information when the infrastructure is hosted on the OutSystems cloud. Previously, when making requests to the endpoints lifetimeapi/rest/v2/environments/ and lifetimeapi/rest/v2/environments/{EnvironmentKey}, the HostName attribute would not return the public host name. This issue has been addressed, and the endpoints now correctly provide the public host name. (RPM-4465) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented deployment plans from starting. This would happen in some scenarios when an environment is placed in maintenance mode and its state has not been fully synchronized with LifeTime. This would also affect deployment plans that do not include (either as a source or target) the environment that is in maintenance mode. (RPM-4629) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
</ul>
