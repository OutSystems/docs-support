<li>[AI Models] 
It is now possible to set a daily token limit for each of your AI Models on the AI Model configuration page. When the limit is reached, the CallAIModel will raise an exception indicating that it has been reached and no more calls will be allowed until the daily reset. 

To be able to view the token usage for your AI Models in the ODC Portal, you will need to have monitoring access, specifically access to asset logs and traces. (RPOR-23859)</li>
