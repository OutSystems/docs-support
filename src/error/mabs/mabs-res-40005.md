# OS-MABS-RES-40005

## Error message

`Couldn’t fetch your app resources. If the problem persists, check our documentation for more information.`

## Cause

This error occurs when MABS isn't able to fetch the resources required to generate the application.

This error is caused by the platform providing MABS with links to app resources that MABS can't access.

## Impact

Users can't generate the application package.

## Recommended action

Check the build logs for more details about the error. Then, try to generate your application again.

If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-MABS-RES-50002).
