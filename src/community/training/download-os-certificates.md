# How to download OutSystems certificates of your team

OutSystems certification is an important step in a developer’s career. Because it’s also an assurance of proficiency and skill, we're making it easier for managers to access their employees’ certificates and track their career progress.

## You are a customer manager

All managers with **infrastructure administrator** and **company administrator** roles ([read about these roles here](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/Managing_your_company_permissions_on_OutSystems_Customer_Portal)) can download all their team certificates in the Account Settings tab in the Customer Portal. If you’re a manager with one of these roles, do the following:

From the Customer Portal, you can also monitor the certification progress of everyone on your team and learn whether your developers passed or failed the exam.

If you don’t see your team in the customer area portal, you might need to invite them ([read how to manage members](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/Managing_your_company_permissions_on_OutSystems_Customer_Portal)).

## You are a partner manager
