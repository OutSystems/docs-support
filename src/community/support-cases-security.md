# Enhanced security for OutSystems support cases

As a subscription customer, your cases can contain sensitive or private information. OutSystems is committed to complying with the highest security standards, ensuring that we communicate with you in a secure way.

So, to add more security to the process while also speeding up the response time, on Dec. 4, 2017, OutSystems has introduced a policy requiring anyone submitting a ticket to be authorized before we proceed with the case.

This policy will only affect you if you are missing key contacts, or they aren't updated in your [Customer Portal](https://www.outsystems.com/cs-home/). Therefore, we recommend you to review your company permissions to ensure that your list of contacts is updated and correct. Make sure you also remove any members that should no longer have access.

## What if someone who isn't on the list submits a ticket?

* Requests made by anyone not on your contacts list will have to go through a formal approval process. This will likely slow down our response time for users that aren't members of your Customer Portal.

* Once approved, we will start working on your request. The user that was approved will be able to open cases in the future without having them suspended.

## How can you get your case approved?

* **As an administrator**, you will receive an email notification where you'll be able to **Authorize** or **Ignore** the request. Any Infrastructure administrator will also be able to go to the Support Portal and authorize or ignore the ticket.

* **As the new user**, please refer to your administrators to approve your requests.

## How can administrators ensure that member's cases' don't get suspended? 

Review your [company permissions](https://www.outsystems.com/cs-home/) and members:

* add as a member those that you wish to allow opening tickets
* remove any member that should no longer have access

[This article](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/Managing_your_company_permissions_on_OutSystems_Customer_Portal) explains the different permissions and how to manage them.
