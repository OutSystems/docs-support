<ul>
<li>We fixed an issue where, on a newly promoted application, mobile builds with MABS 11.2 and above and at least 4 secrets configured (signing assets included) were failing without any information in the error message. (RPM-6298)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where MABS 12 Cordova build request was resulting in MABS 12 Capacitor build request (RPM-6375)</li>
<li>EmailAddressValidate when called on the client side now behaves the same as when called on the server side: it accepts lists of emails and rejects emails with adjacent periods (..). (RPM-6409)</li>
</ul>
