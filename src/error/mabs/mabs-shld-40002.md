# OS-MABS-SHLD-40002

## Error message

`The AppShield's extensibility configurations can't be changed.`

## Cause

This error occurs when the AppShield plugin extensibility configurations have been changed.

## Impact

The application package can't be generated.

## Recommended action

Install the OutSystems AppShield plugin from the [Forge](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/9379/outsystems-appshield) and request a new build, without changing its extensibility configurations.

If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-MABS-SHLD-40002).
