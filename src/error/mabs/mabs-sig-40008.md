# OS-MABS-SIG-40008

## Error message

`There was an issue reading the certificate keys.`

## Cause

This error occurs when MABS can't process or find the necessary information in the provisioning profile.

## Impact

Users can't generate the application package.

## Recommended action

Check if the provisioning profile is valid and if it has the correct format (only `.mobileprovision` extension is valid). Otherwise, replace it and retry.
