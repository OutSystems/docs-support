# OS-MABS-PLG-40016

## Error message

`Couldn't install the Cordova plugin due to a missing dependency in module
<node_module>. Check your plugin dependencies and try again.`

## Cause

This error happened because the installation of the plugin requires the node
module **&lt;node_module&gt;**.

## Impact

Users can't generate the application package.

## Recommended action

Check the build logs on Service Center to confirm which custom plugin requires
the missing node module and fix the dependency.

From MABS 7 upwards (see
[here](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/Mobile_Apps_Build_Service_Versions/MABS_7_Release_notes#:~:text=Xcode%20required%20in%20package.json)),
plugins are installed using Cordova fetch and they need the hooks
dependencies declared on the plugin package.json.
