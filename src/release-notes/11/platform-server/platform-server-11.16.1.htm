<b>Fixed an error when setting IT users permissions and there are more than 1000 application permissions. This issue applied only to environments using an Oracle database.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
When registering a new Oracle environment in the infrastructure through the LifeTime console, the environment synchronization generated several errors in the advanced query RemoveDeprecatedPermissions, which is executed by an internal Platform Server API. This problem only occurred for Oracle environments having more than 1000 application permissions.

<b>Now, there's a compilation message about potential incompatible consumers when a Service module is renamed and published, and those consumers are considered outdated applications in LifeTime.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <span class="cattag">Refresh References</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
*Symptoms*
Service Actions started to return a "404 not found" error after a Lifetime staging due to consumer apps not being marked as outdated.

*How to reproduce*
1. Create an eSpace that consumer a service action from another module (can be a different application or not);
2. Change the service action name and republish it;
3. Perform a staging of the app containing the service eSpace and confirm that Lifetime will not stage the consumer application;
4. In the target environment using the consumer eSpace attempt to invoke the service action;

<b>Fixed an issue with Javascript script configured as required to ensure it is loaded before the AplicationReady event.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
*Symptoms*
When the OnApplicationReady event uses JavaScript that is loaded on a Script that is required by the module, sometimes the OnApplicationReady event fails to use the Script since it was not loaded yet.

*How to reproduce*
Although not easily reproducible since it depends on a race condition, the steps should be:
- Create a Script that stores a global value (ex: on window).
- Make that script a required script on the module.
- Create an OnApplicationReady event handler.
- On the event handler, create a JavaScript node that makes use of the global value.
- When the race condition happens, the value should not be available.

<b>Fixed a validation issue in the Dropdown widget for Reactive Web and Mobile apps when the "Empty Text" property is set.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Interface</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
This issue occurred in Reactive Web Apps and Mobile Apps having a Dropdown widget with the "Empty Text" property set. When a value was selected in the Dropdown, after clearing that value by setting the bound variable value to its default, the Widget would incorrectly pass the required validation although no value was selected.
</p>

<a id="RPM-2388"><strong>RPM-2388</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed an issue that prevented attributes from being correctly imported from certain database views into an entity when integrating with an external PostgreSQL database using Integration Studio.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Integration Studio</span> <span class="cattag">Import Wizards</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
When using an OutSystems PostgreSQL Database Connection to consume certain database views in Integration Studio, entity attributes were not correctly imported. This issue would happen to views referencing tables from multiple schemas from the database connection.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-2409"><strong>RPM-2409</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed an issue in the DropDownMenu widget of RichWidgets that prevented the menu from collapsing after clicking away from it. Applies only to Traditional Web apps.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">System Components</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
After upgrading to Platform Server 11.15.0, application menus in Traditional Web apps wouldn't collapse after clicking away from them. This was caused by an issue in the RichWidgets DropdownMenu when used inside a menu block with items.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-2539"><strong>RPM-2539</strong></a><br/>
<b>Improved database query performance during the platform's telemetry collection. Applies only to Oracle databases.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
In environments using an Oracle database, the execution of Service Center's Timer SynchronizeMetrics, which collects platform telemetry, was causing several timeouts. The issue was related to Oracle's execution plan.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-2540"><strong>RPM-2540</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed an open redirect vulnerability in the HTTPRequestHandler extension. CVSSv3.1 score 4.7 (Medium).</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">System Components</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
The ReplaceURLDomain action of the HTTPRequestHandler extension was lacking some specific user input validations, thus being vulnerable to some detected patterns.
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-2606"><strong>RPM-2606</strong></a><br/>
<b>Fixed a bug in which Static Entity records of type Date/Time with expressions containing whitespaces resulted in compilation errors.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span> <span class="cattag">Deployment stage</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
With Platform Server 11.15.0 and Lifetime 11.10.8, the improved type conversion logic was added by RPM-1653 to improve ability of the compilation to handle types in static entity records that could be automatically converted.
In this case the logic is incorrectly detecting a DateTime expression when there are Time or Date literals with surrounding whitespaces. Like " #10:11:12#"
</p>
<p>
<a id="RPM-819"><strong>RPM-819</strong></a><br/>
<b>Improved the performance of application synchronization when publishing a solution.</b><br/>
<span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> <br/>
<br/>
<u>Fix Details:</u><br/>
Environments with a high number of applications, having frequent solution publishing at the same time as developers execute 1-Click Publish in Service Studio, could experience deadlock errors during LifeTime's synchronization process. This issue was due to the incorrect trigger of the environment synchronization in LifeTime every time a solution was published, instead of synchronizing only the applications involved in the solution.
