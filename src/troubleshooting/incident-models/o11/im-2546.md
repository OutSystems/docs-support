<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>

This error will happen due to the <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/managing_the_applications_lifecycle/manage_it_users/it_users_integration_with_external_idp_via_openid_connect/configuring_lifetime_authentication/">Username claim not being correctly set</a>.

For Azure and Okta implementations, you must use the <strong>preferred_username</strong>claim in the Username Claim section, this way you will be able to proceed with using the desired implementation.
