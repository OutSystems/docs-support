<li>Fixed an issue for OutSystems hybrid infrastructures that was preventing the registration of on-premises environments when the environment connects to LifeTime using HTTPS. (RPD-3781)</li>
<li>For OutSystems hybrid infrastructures, it's now possible to set the maintenance window for the LifeTime environment by setting the maintenance window for the leftmost cloud environment in the infrastructure.
