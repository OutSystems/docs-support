<h2 id="platform_server_release_jan.2019">Platform Server Release Jan.2019</h2>
<div class="info"><p>Removed from availability on Mar 21, 2019</p>
</div>
<h3 id="new_in_platform_server_release_jan.2019">New in Platform Server Release Jan.2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Service Actions in Service Center analytics reports. (ABE-618)</li>
<li>Enabled slow Service Action calls to be displayed in Lifetime's analytics. (ABE-619)</li>
<li>It is now possible to consume SOAP Web Services with binary type inputs. (RINT-3228)</li>
<li>You can now customize the mobile app version code in Service Center. This number is used by app stores to determine whether one version is more recent than another. To set the version code, navigate to Service Center &gt; Factory &gt; your mobile app &gt; Native Platforms, then click the Change link in the Code column. (RLIT-2106)</li>
<li>When configuring a mobile application, it is now possible to choose the version of the Mobile Apps Build Service (MABS) that will be used to generate the mobile app package. (RNMT-2296)</li>
<li>Cache invalidation service binaries are now fetched from the official repository. (RRCT-2050)</li>
<li>Improved the UI of the Deployment Zones screen in Service Center. (RSAT-1132)</li>
<li>Added README files that guide the user to more specific documentation on container deployment. These files are automatically added to the configured "Target Output" folder of the container hosting technology on the first deployment to the container. (RSAT-1078)</li>
<li>The base FROM image for Docker-based container hosting technologies - Amazon ECS, Azure Container Service, Docker Containers - has been changed from "microsoft/iis:latest" to "microsoft/dotnet-framework:4.7.1-runtime". The Deployment Zones associated with these container hosting technologies and using "microsoft/iis:latest" as the FROM image will be upgraded to use "microsoft/dotnet-framework:4.7.1-runtime". Deployment Zones that are already using a different FROM image will be kept unchanged. This change will increase the time of the first application deployment to containers, as the first layers of the OutSystems application image will need to be rebuilt. (RSAT-1105)</li>
<li>Deployment timeouts for Container Deployment Zones are now configurable in Service Center. (RSAT-1103)</li>
<li>Modified the default paths for Amazon ECS and Azure Container Service hosting technologies. (RSAT-1100)</li>
<li>The unattended installation and upgrade process now validates the prerequisites. (RSAT-1023)</li>
</ul>
