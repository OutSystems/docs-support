# How to install a license file

<div class="info" markdown="1">

This article applies to on-premises environments. For OutSystems Cloud, our services manage the license installation automatically, updating it or renewing it as necessary.

</div>

Follow these steps to install the license file on your environment:

1. Navigate to the environment management console at `http://<yourenvironment>/ServiceCenter`;

2. Click the '**Administration**' tab, and navigate to the '**Licensing**' submenu;

3. Use the '**Backup License**' link to download the license currently installed. It's always a good idea to keep backups;

4. Click the '**Upload New License**' link, to install the new license.

License files are bound to a given environment / Serial Number and if you try to install them on other environments you'll get an error.
</div>

If that happens confirm that you downloaded the right file by comparing the Serial Numbers shown in Service Center and Licensing Portal.
