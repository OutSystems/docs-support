# Log streaming errors

Log streaming errors may occur when configuring a connection to an application performance monitoring (APM) tool in LifeTime.
The connection details are used to establish a connection to the APM tool. If that connection fails, a specific error code is thrown.
Check the specific error page on the table of contents for information about the cause and resolution of a specific error.
