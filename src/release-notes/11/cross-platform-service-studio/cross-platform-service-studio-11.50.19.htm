<ul>
<li>Installing a template (sample app) just got simpler. No dependency dialog is shown during installation. (RDEPT-3)</li>
<li>Ability to refresh existing REST Integrations, enabling additional productivity to users. (RDOIBT-83)</li>
<li>The validation rule for a mobile App Identifier in Service Center is now aligned with iOS and Android app stores. The validation messages were also updated accordingly. (RMAC-7346)</li>
<li>You can now use the grid columns to accurately resize the elements of a screen in a fixed or fluid layout. Instead of previously resizing without seeing parent's available space nor knowing the grid layout width, you now have a better idea of the available space in elements because the IDE UI shows the column number. This change makes the process of the UI design more efficient. (RTAFA-146)</li>
<li>Now you can configure friendly URLs in your Reactive Web Apps. Go to Service Center &gt; Administration &gt; SEO URLs to set up the site rules and redirects. Configure the page rules in Service Studio, by setting Custom URLs to Yes in the Screen properties. (RTAFB-4453)</li>
