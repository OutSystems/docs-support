In some cases, the injected code runs with high privileges on the OutSystems platform.

OutSystems notified cloud customers and updated or applied a patch to all affected cloud infrastructures.

The environments were patched without the need for a platform server version update. 

### On-Premises Installations

OutSystems issued new releases of the Platform Server that address this vulnerability.
All customers who have yet to update their Platform servers are strongly encouraged to do so.

#### OutSystems 10

This vulnerability is fixed for Platform Server version 10.0.1005.2 and all subsequent versions.


#### OutSystems 11

The vulnerability is fixed for Platform Server version Release Jan.2019 CP2 and all subsequent versions.


### Workaround

A Platform Server upgrade is strongly advised. If you do not have the opportunity to upgrade your on-premises Platform, we advise you to disable the ECT Provider component for all eSpaces.

OutSystems PaaS infrastructures do not require any workaround as they were all patched and are protected.
