<div class="info">Released on Oct 02, 2019</div>
<h3 id="new_in_platform_server_release_oct.2019">New in Platform Server Release Oct.2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can now create a new type of app, <a class="link-https" href="https://www.outsystems.com/DocRouter/Router.aspx?PlatformToolName=ServiceStudio&amp;PlatformVersionNumber=11.0&amp;HelpId=30195" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reactive Web App</a>. This type of app is based on the client-side development paradigm. Reactive App comes with its own new features: Table Widget, server-side pagination, and Public Screens. (RTAF-115)</li>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left:35px;">
<a class="link-https" href="https://www.outsystems.com/DocRouter/Router.aspx?PlatformToolName=ServiceStudio&amp;PlatformVersionNumber=11.0&amp;HelpId=30198" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Table Widget</a>, available in the <a class="link-https" href="https://www.outsystems.com/DocRouter/Router.aspx?PlatformToolName=ServiceStudio&amp;PlatformVersionNumber=11.0&amp;HelpId=30195" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reactive Web</a> apps, comes with an accelerator: drag an Entity on it to create a table with sorting and pagination. Use tables to show data in cells distributed in rows and columns. (RTAF-204)</li>
<li style="margin-left:35px;">Use the server-side pagination feature of the Screen Aggregates to build faster apps that need to handle large data sets. Enter the Start Index and fetch the number of records you define in Max Records. (RTAF-630)</li>
<li style="margin-left:35px;">Public Screens will allow you to reuse UI across different Reactive Web modules and apps. Because the UI can be modular, you can now have more complex UI modules that you can maintain efficiently. You can collaborate better without merge conflicts, as one team can be working on the logic module, while the other is updating the UI module. (RTAF-198)</li>
<li style="margin-left:35px;">Download Tool is available in Reactive Apps. Now you can drag a Download Tool to your Flow and create a node which, when executed, sends a file for download to the end-user. (RTAF-993)</li>
</ul>
<li>You can now create <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Developing_an_Application/Reuse_and_Refactor/Libraries" rel="internal">Libraries</a> in Mobile and Reactive Web apps. This new module type is especially tailored for building highly reusable logic and UI and fits directly in the Foundation layer of the 4 Layer Canvas. (RSBO-708)</li>
<li>The checklist and documentation instruction links now include the required steps for the Microsoft .NET Core 2.1 Windows Server Hosting. Additionally, the recommended version has been raised to 2.1.12. (RPC-254)</li>
<li>Improved the solution publication messages regarding the database update to have more details about each step (RRCT-2429)</li>
<li>We improved Data Sources and made asynchronous data fetching straightforward to use in Mobile and Reactive Apps. Screen Aggregates and Data Actions are now available in the scope of other Screen Aggregates and Data Actions. We also added the Fetch property with On Start and On Demand options. Now you can <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Developing_an_Application/Use_Data/Query_Data/Implement_asynchronous_data_fetching_using_Aggregates" rel="internal">implement patterns such as master/detail</a> with an excellent performance and user experience. (RTAF-990)</li>
<li>Now you can create <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_Language/Data/Handling_Data/Client_Variable" rel="internal">Client Variables</a> in Mobile and Reactive Apps. Use Client Variables to store Basic Data Types locally or share the values across apps through public Blocks and public Client Actions. (RTAF-1051)</li>
<li>The <a class="link-https" href="https://www.outsystems.com/DocRouter/Router.aspx?PlatformToolName=ServiceStudio&amp;PlatformVersionNumber=11.0&amp;HelpId=30208" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dropdown Widget</a> has a new property Options Content, which you can set to Text Only or Custom. Text Only gives a native look and feel of the drop-down lists in your Reactive and Mobile apps. Use Options Content property set to Custom to build a list of images or other Widgets. (RTAF-1207)</li>
<li>Button Widgets in Mobile and Reactive Apps now have the Is Form Default property, which you can set to Yes and make the App submit the data from the related form when the end-user presses the Enter key. (RTAF-652)</li>
<li>The Users application now includes specific configurations for OKTA, for authenticating the end-users of your OutSystems applications. (RSBO-791)</li>
<li>Added Server.Identity service to support platform authentication. (RPC-82)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="breaking_change_release_oct.2019">Breaking Change</h3>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded Oracle Data Provider for .NET, Managed driver to version 19.3.1 (4.122.19.1:20190703).

According to the <a class="link-https" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/odpnt/InstallSystemRequirements.html#GUID-A6405CAD-C0E9-45E0-9C38-26B7ED214479" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official documentation</a>, this driver allows applications to connect to Oracle Database 11g Release 2 or later.<b>If you have integrations with earlier versions of Oracle Database, they will not work. You will need to upgrade your Oracle engine to version 11g Release 2 or later, in order to continue using those integrations.</b>

This driver supports native encryption, meaning that you can set up your database to require encryption and this means all connections will be encrypted between the server and the database (applicable for the platform and external databases). (RSAT-1723)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="known_issues_release_oct.2019">Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>When using an External Authentication provider (Active Directory or LDAP), if a user tries to view the details of a module in Service Center, he is redirected to the Service Center homepage.</li>
