<h3>Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an error that occurred in the generation step while publishing integrations. The issue occurred when object names included special characters leading to the duplication of object names. (RCNT-4602)</li>
<li>Improved the experience on the  "Add tables" step of the integration creation wizard for relational databases. Now, long table names don't cause a horizontal scroll. (RCNT-4662)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an  OS-INBL-GEN -50009 error while publishing integrations with Salesforce.  The issue prevented the generation of integrations that included object names that didn't contain any roman alphabet characters. (RPM-2266)</li>
