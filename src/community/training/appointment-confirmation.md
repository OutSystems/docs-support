# Did not receive the exam appointment confirmation email

Once candidates complete their registration and exam schedule, they should receive the email with the subject **Appointment confirmation** email which includes the exam information.

In case candidates can't locate the email on the Inbox, SPAM or Junk email folders then they should open a [support case](https://www.outsystems.com/SPP_Ticket_UI/open-support-case), as the team will be sure to make it available for you as soon as possible.
