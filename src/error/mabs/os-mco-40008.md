# OS-MCO-40008

## Error message

`<AssetName> version <AssetVersion> requires at least MABS <MabsVersion>.`

## Cause

Some libraries declare a minimum required MABS version to ensure compatibility with the features or APIs they use. When your mobile app uses these libraries, it must be built using a MABS version that is equal to or higher than the version required by those libraries.

## Impact

The mobile compilation fails, causing the native mobile build to fail.

## Recommended action

Build your mobile app using a MABS version that is equal to or higher than the minimum required version for its libraries. OutSystems recommends keeping your MABS version up to date to comply with Apple and Google guidelines and to benefit from the latest features, improvements, and security patches.

If that's not possible due to compatibility issues with other libraries, you can remove the libraries that require a higher MABS version from your mobile app.

You can also downgrade the libraries that require a higher MABS version to versions that are compatible with your current MABS version, if such versions exist.

If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-MCO-40008).
