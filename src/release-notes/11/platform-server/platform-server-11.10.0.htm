<div class="info"><p>Released on Nov 09, 2020</p></div>

<h3 id="new_in_platform_server_11.10.0" >New in Platform Server 11.10.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>The error logs about the server responses in Mobile/Reactive apps now have information about the endpoint in use. (RAR-259)</li>
<li>You can now try out the Reactive and Mobile applications using the React 16 version. Start by enabling this technical preview feature in LifeTime. (RAR-270)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that was blocking the user to set big extensibility configurations on LifeTime.
It depends on LifeTime version 11.6.1. (RLIT-3938)</li>
<li>Added support for email SMTP servers using implicit SSL connections on port 465. (RPD-4025)</li>
<li>It is now possible to apply settings to the OutSystems factory using a command-line flag of Configuration Tool. (RPD-4862)</li>

<li>Upgraded NLog libraries to version 4.7.2. (RRCT-2965)</li>
<li>Improved the third-party libraries version algorithm added in the previous Platform Server versions to be more resilient regarding extensions that were created incorrectly. (RRCT-3102)</li>
<li>Platform Server installation logs are now placed on the %localappdata%\OutSystems\PlatformInstaller folder. (RSAT-2289)</li>
<li>You can now optimize the amount of data transferred from the server side to the client side of Mobile and Reactive Web Apps. The optimization works for Screen Aggregates, Data Actions, and for the Server Actions in the logic flows of Screen Client Actions. This is a technical preview feature and you need to activate the option "Client-side optimizations for Reactive Web Apps" or "Client-side optimizations for Mobile Apps". (RTAFB-3260)</li>
<li>You can now translate the UI of your Reactive Web Apps and Mobile Apps directly inside Service Studio. Multilingual is a technical preview feature and you need to activate the option "Multilingual for Mobile and Reactive" in LifeTime. After enabling the feature, use the new Multilingual Locales folder and new SetCurrentLocale system client action. (RTAFB-3388)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_platform_server_11.10.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the app upgrade mechanism when technical preview "Configure Mobile application updates distribution" is on. Previously, a native mobile app would still use the hybrid updates on the first load. (RAR-219)</li>

<li>Fixed broken image links to images in Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps when using a referenced action from another module to get the image. (RPD-5111)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Popup_Editor block from RichWidgets was largely increasing the ViewState size by deprecating it into the Deprecated_Popup_Editor block and splitting it into two new blocks: The Popup_EditorForUpload to be used for the Popup_Upload screen, which requires some data on the ViewState; and the Popup_Editor to be used with any other screen, which does not require data on the ViewState. (RPD-5221)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that occurred while using Oracle as the platform database that recreated indexes of entities on every publish of the module. (RPM-310)</li>
<li>Fixed SSO between different app types so the roles are correctly updated and users are no longer blocked from accessing the screens in the session. (RPM-312)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the static entities that shared the same first 10 characters to have the same translation table. This only affects Platform's that use Oracle database. (RPM-313)</li>
<li>Fixed compilation error that occurred when there was a new attribute in a producer structure with a default value that wasn't refreshed in a consumer. (RPD-5039) (RPM-316)</li>

<li>Timestamps used for session fixation protection are now stored using the UTC time zone. This prevents checks from being too aggressive during Daylight Saving Time transitions. (RRCT-3051)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where applications became unavailable while publishing solutions due to License Validations. (RRCT-3215)</li>
<li>Updated the MySQL driver to version 8.0.21 and updated its dependencies. (RSAT-1965)</li>
<li>Improvement on performance for session model in Oracle. To take advantage of this improvement, you will need to upgrade the Session Database in Configuration Tool. (RSAT-1977)</li>
