# Vulnerability RPD-2903

## Overview

OutSystems has identified a security vulnerability on the authentication mechanism used for communication between OutSystems Platform components that could allow users that have limited access to one environment to elevate privileges on that environment and on other environments managed by the same LifeTime.

OutSystems has assessed the impact of this vulnerability for both cloud and on-premises deployments, and across all supported stacks. The information in this article will allow you to ascertain the level of exposure your systems may have, and how you should proceed to solve the threat.

   * **Public disclosure**: Full details on this vulnerability were already disclosed.

### Vulnerability details

The basis for this vulnerability is a "[Pass the Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash)" attack. Some internal web services used to accept hashes as authentication. This means that a developer can obtain the hash for any user’s password from the database and use it to authenticate against these web services. These web services allow high privilege operations on the Platform, including a way to login with that user in Service Center. Only IT users that already have access to LifeTime and Service Center can exploit this vulnerability. Once that user obtains a hash, he can utilize it from any point where Service Center is available.
