<div class="info"><p>Released on Sep 03, 2024</p></div>


<style>.cattag {background: #f4f2ff; color: #6a6581; padding: 4px 10px;}</style>
<h3 id="new_in_platform_server_11.30.0" >New in Platform Server 11.30.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed some unused Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc dependencies. This change only affects Server.API, Server.Identity system applications and OutSystems services. (R11BRT-1182)</li>
<li>Updated System.Text.Json library bundled with the platform from version 6.0.8 to version 8.0.4
Updated System.Text.Encodings.Web library bundled with the platform from version 4.7.2 to version 8.0.0 (R11BRT-1199)</li>
<li>Revamped the implementation of client-side DateTime, Date, and Time types (Reactive and Mobile). This includes new protection against local timezone changes that could shift the Dates, Times, and Null values (e.g. Dates moving to the previous day, Times moving a few hours, or Null values not being null anymore). Additionally, this feature imposes that Dates and DateTimes are within the OutSystems supported validity range between #1900-01-01 00:00:00# - #3000-12-31 23:59:59#. New or existing values outside this range will be considered Null. This feature is optional and can be turned on in Factory Configuration 11.2.2. (R11DT-2566)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_platform_server_11.30.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause a timeout in Configuration Tool when installing System Components. (R11BRT-1185)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused modules publication to be stuck during Deploying or Preparing deploy phases.
This could occur after restarting Deployment Service at the same time there’s an ongoing deployment.
Now, these interrupted deployments aren’t kept in a locked state after service restarts. (R11BRT-1187)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in FormatDateTime client built-in action that caused the timezone offset to be formatted with a double minus sign in timezones behind UTC. E.g. FormatDateTime(#2024-06-25 07:00:00#, "HH:mm:ss zzz") would return "07:00:00 --1:00" if the device was located in timezone UTC-1. Now, it outputs "07:00:00 -01:00". (R11DT-2573)</li>
<li>Now, when adding a tabIndex attribute to a Reactive/Mobile Dropdown widget, this attribute is applied to the Select tag instead of the enclosing Div. This only applies when Options Content in the Dropdown properties is set to 'Text Only'. The change allows setting a focus order more effectively when navigating through the screen by tapping. (RPM-1199) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span>  <span class="cattag">Compilation</span> </li>
<li>Improved the performance of the getVersionedUrl function, which is used by the underlying javascript code of Mobile and Reactive apps. Despite being neglectable in most cases, it can present an improvement of several milliseconds on more complex applications. (RPM-3348) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue where using sort or filter in a query to a local entity, and that local entity was renamed in the consumer module, the query would fail. Now the query will yield the expected results. (RPM-4638) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Data Access and Manipulation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused a misleading error message.
This error occurred when attempting to publish an OML file via the application page.
Now, only OAP files can be published through the application page. (RPM-4955) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> </li>
<li>Update Oracle Managed Driver to version 19.23.0. See the Oracle release notes, for more information on related fixes. 
This includes a tentative fix for timeouts happening while retrieving connections from the connection pool in Oracle databases when the max connections is not being reached.  (RPM-4971) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Data Access and Manipulation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused modules in the detach process to not copy correctly all the third party dependencies that were necessary, causing runtime errors in particular for System.Text.Json.
The detach process, documentation was also updated to reflect similar situations that required manual steps that could not be automated. (RPM-5102) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Application Detach</span> </li>
<li>Fixed 2 security issues that could cause
server-side request forgery to occur. CVSSv3.1 score 6.1 and 4.3. (RPM-5151) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Logic Execution</span> </li>
</ul>
