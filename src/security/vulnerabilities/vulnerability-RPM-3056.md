## Vulnerability summary

A security vulnerability was identified in the OutSystems Platform Server that, if exploited, may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Platform Server. OutSystems doesn't have any evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited in the OutSystems Cloud.

## Affected products

Platform Server and LifeTime.

### Vulnerable products and versions

This vulnerability affects all versions of Platform Server and LifeTime.

## Vulnerability details

Further details on this vulnerability will be published only on the date of public disclosure.

## Workarounds

There's no workaround, we strongly advise to upgrade to the fixed versions. There are some mitigation actions:

* For **OutSystems 11 Cloud customers**, additional controls at the infrastructure level already mitigate the external exposure.

* For **self-managed**, ensure that your infrastructure is properly configured in line with the [OutSystems Network Requirements](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setup_and_maintain_your_OutSystems_infrastructure/Setting_Up_OutSystems/OutSystems_network_requirements). Ensuring you only allow connections to each port from the sources listed on the network requirements.

For a permanent fix, customers must upgrade to the new releases of both Platform Server and LifeTime.

## Fixed products and versions

OutSystems issued new releases that address this vulnerability. All subsequent releases will be protected. 

* Platform Server 11.18.1
* LifeTime 11.16.1

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Upgrading to these releases brings some additional steps that you'll need to perform that aren't a part of the standard upgrade.
Check the section [Additional actions when upgrading](#additional-actions) for instructions.
</div>


If you have a self-managed infrastructure we strongly encourage upgrading to the latest release.

For OutSystems Cloud infrastructures, you'll receive a schedule that will include the upgrade period in each environment.


## Exploitation and public announcements

The OutSystems Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) has been able to reproduce the vulnerability proving it can be exploited.
 

## Additional actions when upgrading {#additional-actions}

To fix the vulnerability, during the upgrade you'll need to upgrade your apps and activate **Enhanced security for Remoting requests**. Below are the specific instructions for these 2 steps.

### General guidance {#general-guidance}

* For guidance on any upgrade check [Upgrade OutSystems platform](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setup_and_maintain_your_OutSystems_infrastructure/Upgrade_OutSystems_platform).

* Review and assess the potential breaking changes that may have impact on your apps. For more information, refer to [OutSystems 11 side effects and breaking changes](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/11/OutSystems_11_side_effects_and_breaking_changes).

* Upgrade your infrastructure

    The specific process to upgrade an infrastructure is very specific to each factory depending on the state of development in each environment or whether breaking changes are involved. You should chose the process and deployment order that best suits your scenario.
    
    In the OutSystems Cloud, you'll receive a communication that will include the schedule for each environment. As in any other OutSystems Cloud Platform Server upgrade, you can expect:

    * A downtime of 30 minutes in each environment except for environments that have multiple front-ends. 
    * A total maintenance period of up to 4 hours in each environment (the actual time depends on server load and number of applications).

    Regardless of your upgrade process, to fix this vulnerability you'll need to ensure that:

    * LifeTime is the first environment to be upgraded.
    * After the upgrade is completed in any environment (LifeTime included), apps are also upgraded. You can deploy via LifeTime (provided that the target environments are already upgraded) or even use [all components solutions](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/How-to_Guides/DevOps/Creating_and_using_an_All_Components_solution). What's important to retain is that apps are upgraded after the servers are upgraded.
    

* Activate **Enhanced security for Remoting requests**. This setting is turned on per environment (including in LifeTime itself). For more instructions see [Activating Enhanced security for Remoting requests](#remoting).

Once this is ensured, your OutSystems platform is no longer vulnerable to this threat.

### Upgrade your apps {#deploy-all-actions}

Use [all components solutions](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/How-to_Guides/DevOps/Creating_and_using_an_All_Components_solution) or deploy via LifeTime to upgrade your apps.

### Activating the Enhanced security for Remoting requests setting {#remoting}

<div class="warning" markdown="1">

Once this setting is activated any app compiled with a version prior to Platform Server 11.18.1 will stop working. For this reason, OutSystems recommends that you make sure to [upgrade your apps](#deploy-all-actions) before activating this setting.

This is a one-way setting, meaning once the setting is activated it can't be deactivated.

</div>

#### After upgrading LifeTime

* In the **OutSystems Cloud**, for LifeTime, this setting will be automatically enabled and any apps present in the LifeTime environment will be upgraded as a part of the OutSystems Cloud LifeTime upgrade. If you have apps deployed to the LifeTime environment (such as LifeTime plugins, for example), check if they're working correctly. Contact support if you find any issue.

* In **self-managed** infrastructures, do the following:

    1. In LifeTime's Service Center, go to **Administration > Security**.
    1. Select the **Enhanced security for Remoting requests** checkbox and click **Save**.

    Enhanced security for Remoting requests is now activated for the LifeTime environment.

#### After upgrading the environment

You can activate the setting in each environment (for example, Development, Test, Production) as it's upgraded. Make sure apps are upgraded, then activate the setting. 

1. Connect to LifeTime, and go to **Environments** (for OutSystems Cloud) or **Infrastructure** (for self-managed). 
1. In the box corresponding to the upgraded environment (for example: Development), click **Environment Security**.
1. Select the **Enhanced security for Remoting requests** checkbox and click **Save**.

Enhanced security for Remoting requests is now activated for the upgraded environment (for example: Development). Repeat the operation in the other environments once they're upgraded and apps are deployed.

If the upgraded environment is not managed by LifeTime, you can activate the setting in Service Center under **Administration > Security**. 


## FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **What do I need to do?** | Update your OutSystems platform to the above-mentioned version that applies. |
| **Why do I need to upgrade and publish all modules to fix the vulnerability?** | To ensure all apps are upgraded. |
| **I can't find Platform Server 11.18.0 and LifeTime 11.16.0.** | Due to [known issues](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/11/Platform_Server#known_issues_fixing_platform_server_11.18.0) found that affect those versions, they've been retracted. New releases (Platform Server 11.18.1 and LifeTime 11.16.1) have been released and are the one that should be used. |
| **Do I need to generate new builds for mobile apps?**| No. The security fix affects only backend code and doesn't affect the mobile native code.  |
| **Can I temporarily revert the vulnerability fix if my apps are severely affected (production down) by this change?** | No. However, the **Enhanced security for Remoting requests** setting, while **disabled**, provides backward compatibility. While this setting is disabled, apps compiled in versions prior to Platform Server 11.18.1 can communicate with the Platform Server. Once activated, they can no longer communicate and the setting canâ€™t be disabled again. |
| **If I decide to opt-out or delay upgrades until after the end of the embargo phase, what should I do?** | Due to the complexity of this upgrade and associated security risks, **Cloud customers cannot opt-out**. <br/><br/> Not complying with this required upgrade means you risk exposing your apps and OutSystems to a cyber security threat.<br/><br/>It's mandatory to deploy your upgrades by March 31, 2023, because by that date OutSystems is obliged to disclose the vulnerability details. This will create an unacceptable exposure to these vulnerabilities, to you and OutSystems. In the OutSystems Cloud, any pending upgrades will be forced during the month of March. <br/><br/>OutSystems **strongly recommends Self-Managed customers to upgrade** as soon as possible. If you are using the OutSystems in a self-managed environment and you don't deploy your upgrades by March 31, 2023, you're assuming all risks, legal, security, and otherwise, if that vulnerability is exploited. |
| **Can I request to change the schedule I received to upgrade my OutSystems Cloud?**| Yes, provided that by March 31, 2023 you've completed the upgrade in all environments.|
| **By exploiting this vulnerability can an attacker access my data?** | Yes. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker will have full access to all data stored by the OutSystems Platform. |
| **Has this vulnerability been exploited in the wild?** | OutSystems doesn't have any evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited in the OutSystems Cloud. We're aware of one occurrence in a self-managed infrastructure. |
| **Will OutSystems share any more information about this vulnerability?** | In order to protect its customers, OutSystems will not provide any additional information about this vulnerability before the end of March 2023. |
| **Who can I talk to about this?** | If you have any questions, contact your Customer Success Manager. If you donâ€™t have one, contact us via our [support channels](https://www.outsystems.com/legal/success/contact-outsystems-technical-support/). |
| **Does this vulnerability apply to OutSystems 10?** | Yes, .Net infrastructures, are also affected by this vulnerability. There will be no patching for OutSystems 10. The only way to mitigate these vulnerabilities is to upgrade to OutSystems 11 with the latest versions. |
