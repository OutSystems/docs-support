<li>You can now provide IT Users with SSO capabilities integrated with a Federated External IdP via OpenID Connect (OIDC). Ensuring that IT Users have a better experience avoiding managing many different passwords and, more importantly, enhancing security accessing OutSystems consoles and tools, ensuring authentication is managed in a centralized manner. This capability is in Technical Preview, and you need to activate it in <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/Technical_Preview_features">LifeTime Technical Preview Console</a>. To know more about the new Authentication mechanism, please check our <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Managing_the_Applications_Lifecycle/Secure_the_Applications/Technical_Preview_-_IT_Users_Integration_with_External_IdP_via_OpenId_Connect_(OIDC)">documentation</a>.
