# Restart services on OutSystems Cloud


## Overview 

Should any issues with OutSystems services arise on a cloud environment, you can check the related errors and:

* Retry synchronization to see if it's just a communication issue.
* Restart the OutSystems services in case they got stuck.


This option isn't available in Personal Environments.


## Resolution

On 1 you can check the detail of the error and on 2 you can have some more details about that environment:

On the error report you can try to sync your environment again just to see if this was just a communication problem. If it doesn't resolve the issue, then you can go to the environment details and restart OutSystems services:

Clicking **Restart Services** performs an IIS reset, clears the application pools, and clears any hanging requests. In the case of multiple front-ends, this restart is balanced (front-end servers are restarted one at a time).
