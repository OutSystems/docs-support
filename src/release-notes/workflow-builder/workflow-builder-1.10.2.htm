As with any OutSystems app, user groups must be managed–if you'd like to use the "Requester's manager" capability, it needs to be <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/Workflow_Builder/How_to_set_up_Workflow_Builder">configured during the Workflow Builder setup</a>.</li>
<li>Send email notification to end users, using the prebuilt templates.</li>
<li>Publish your app directly from Workflow Builder to your Development environment, and immediately test it.</li>
<li>Edit the workflow and form fields as many times as you need, until you’re done. Workflow Builder creates two sample users so you can test the app from different users perspectives.</li>
