<ul>
<li>This version introduces a new Security Pattern to Code Quality: "Automatically generated publicly exposed REST endpoint" (RDASS-3332)</li>
<li>ODC Administrators now have the ability to specify whether user emails from a particular Identity Provider (IdP) are trusted. When an IdP is marked as trusted and provides an email_verified claim, that claim will be honored and allow the user to more easily activate their user account on the first login, bypassing the default ODC's email validation step. (RDPP-2680)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
