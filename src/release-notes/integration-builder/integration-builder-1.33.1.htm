<h3 id="bug_fixing_1.33.1">Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an error that would occur when trying to quickly republish several connectors, using the contextual menu on the integrations list. (RCNT-4458)</li>
<li>Fixed: when installing the MongoDB Integration Manager Plugin, the text incorrectly stated an "integration" was being published. (RCNT-4725)</li>
<li>Fixed: For MongoDB connectors, an error message saying the connector had been changed was being displayed incorrectly when a publish operation had to wait for a dependency update process to finish. (RCNT-4729)</li>
<li>Fixed: For relational database connectors, an error message saying the connector had been changed was being displayed incorrectly when a publish operation had to wait for a dependency update process to finish. (RCNT-4771)</li>
<li>Fixed Integration Manager not being updated from version 1 to version 2 when there were no published integrations. This would prevent the installation of the MongoDB Integration Manager Plugin. (RPM-2329)</li>
<li>Now, Integration Builder won't ignore the value of the "Allow editing in Service Studio" property when generating MongoDB connectors. (RPM-2382)</li>
<li>Fixed: A "Connection timeout" error was displayed when listing relational database connections, if there were many connections in Service Center. (RPM-2403)</li>
</ul>
