<h3 id="bug_fixing_outsystems_developer_cloud_2024-01-15" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with handling of multiple refreshes to the same aggregate or data action that caused the OnAfterFetch event handler to run as many times as the refreshes instead of just once for the last refresh. _(RDINC-17172)_ (RAR-2457)</li>
<li>Email screens are now being considered <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/support/licensing/application_objects/">Application Objects</a>. The platform was not considering these objects in the total AO count, which was not expected. This may impact the AO usage limit. (RDPSTT-1529)</li>
</ul>
