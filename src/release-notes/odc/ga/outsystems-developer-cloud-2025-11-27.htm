<ul>
<li>[Mentor AppGen]<br/>
AppGen now generates field-level validation rules for common scenarios, including mandatory fields, past/future date checks, value range enforcement (Numeric, Text, Phone Number), and email validation, based on your app context or explicit requirements.<br/>
<br/>
Mentor can now include Pop-up and Tab patterns when generating new screens, providing more flexible and modern UI designs.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve implemented Popups ViewMode, allowing you to use Edit and View screens within pop-up modals for a faster, more focused user experience.<br/>
<br/>
Added support for more dashboard aggregations, including Minimum, Maximum, Average, and Sum, providing richer data visualization options out of the box. (RDMAG-876)</li>
