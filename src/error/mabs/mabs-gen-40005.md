# OS-MABS-GEN-40005

## Error message

`There was an issue generating the app because {0} ‘{1}’ wasn’t found. Check if your plugins are up to date and compatible with the MABS version you’re using.`

## Cause

Generating the Android application package failed because a custom plugin points to a file that doesn’t exist.

## Impact

The Android application package can't be generated.

## Recommended action

Check the build logs on Service Center to confirm which custom plugin is affecting the package generation and update it.
