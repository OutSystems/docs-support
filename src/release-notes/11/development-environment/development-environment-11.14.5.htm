Use tables to show data in cells distributed in rows and columns. (RTAF-204)</li>
<li>Use the server-side pagination feature of the Screen Aggregates to build faster apps that need to handle large data sets. Enter the Start Index and fetch the number of records you define in Max Records. (RTAF-630)</li>
<li>Public Screens will allow you to reuse UI across different Reactive Web modules and apps. Because the UI can be modular, you can now have more complex UI modules that you can maintain efficiently. You can collaborate better without merge conflicts, as one team can be working on the logic module, while the other is updating the UI module. (RTAF-198)</li>
<li>Download Tool is available in Reactive Apps. Now you can drag a Download Tool to your Flow and create a node which, when executed, sends a file for download to the end-user. (RTAF-993)</li>

This feature requires OutSystems Platform Server 11 Release Oct.2019. (RSBO-811)</li>
<li>The Dropdown Widget has a new property Options Content, which you can set to Text Only or Custom. Text Only gives a native look and feel of the drop-down lists in your Reactive and Mobile apps. Use Options Content property set to Custom to build a list of images or other Widgets. (RTAF-1208)</li>
<li>Button Widgets in Mobile and Reactive Apps now have the Is Form Default property, which you can set to Yes and make the App submit the data from the related form when the end-user presses the Enter key. (RTAF-943)</li>
<li>Now you can create <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_Language/Data/Handling_Data/Client_Variable">Client Variables</a> in Mobile and Reactive Apps. Use Client Variables to store Basic Data Types locally or share the values across apps through public Blocks and public Client Actions. (RTAF-1052)</li>
<li>We improved Data Sources and made asynchronous data fetching straightforward to use in Mobile and Reactive Apps. Screen Aggregates and Data Actions are now available in the scope of other Screen Aggregates and Data Actions. We also added the Fetch property with On Start and On Demand options. Now you can implement patterns such as master/detail with excellent performance and user experience. (RTAF-992)</li>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>Service Studio allows the "Delete Module" operation to be executed in environments with a purpose different from Development. This operation <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setting_Up_OutSystems/Configure_your_OutSystems_environment#Feature_availability_for_different_Purposes">should only be available</a> in environments that have the Development purpose.</li>
<li>When creating a second module in a web application, the blocks ApplicationTitle, MenuIcon and LoginInfo are not automatically added to the references of the module even though they are used in the sample content of the Layout block. To fix the errors, manually add the missing references to the module.</li>
</ul>
