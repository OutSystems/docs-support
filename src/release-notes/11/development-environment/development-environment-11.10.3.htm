<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Service Studio to take several seconds to load an OML when contain screens with thousand of nodes. (RICT-2920)</li>
<li>Fixed a compilation error by adding the missing validations for updated Trigger Event nodes, for example when you copy and paste a Trigger Event between Blocks. Now Service Studio timely warns you about invalid expressions and prevents you from trying to run 1-Click Publish. (RTAF-3793)</li>
