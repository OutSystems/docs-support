# Penetration testing

## Overview

As a subscription customer, you may wish to perform penetration tests or vulnerability scans. This is possible as long as they're limited to your own OutSystems Cloud, hybrid, or self-managed infrastructure.
For OutSystems Cloud, the tests are limited to the assets under the responsibility of the **Customer** as described under the [OutSystems shared responsibility model](../enterprise/maintenance/cloud-shared-responsibility.md).

## Before you start

To avoid generating false positive findings, make sure you consult the [OutSystems Platform Hardening](platform-server-hardening.md) documentation.

To find all the procedure details necessary to perform penetration tests and vulnerability scans in your OutSystems Cloud environments, refer to [Load and penetration tests on OutSystems Cloud](penetration-test-cloud.md).

## Reviewing the results { #review-results }

When reviewing penetration test results, it's important to keep in mind that each penetration test framework reports on findings without a proper context. To detect false positives, these findings must be reviewed. For more information on understanding the findings in their proper context, you can contact OutSystems support [here](https://www.outsystems.com/goto/submit-support-case).

### False positives

The following are some examples of false positive findings. In each one, there's a description of why they're considered as such.

#### jQuery 1.8.3 flagged as a potentially vulnerable library

OutSystems uses jQuery version 1.8.3, which has the following known vulnerabilities:

* Issue - Selector interpreted as HTML.
[CVE-2012-6708](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6708) relates to a potential Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in jQuery's selector operator ($). While the jQuery version we ship with OutSystems is based on version 1.8.3, it contains some changes made by OutSystems. In particular, as of OutSystems version 9.1.401.0, the fix was backported, and the $ operator is no longer vulnerable to this attack.

* Issue - jQuery is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
[CVE-2015-9251](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-9251) indicates jQuery before 3.0.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks when a cross-domain Ajax request is performed without the dataType option. [CVE-2020-7656](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7656) also indicates jQuery prior to 1.9.0 allows Cross-site Scripting attacks via the load method. Although the platform by default doesn't make use of the vulnerable patterns, this was still available for developers or attackers to take advantage of. This has been fixed in [PS 11.11.2](https://success.outsystems.com/support/release_notes/11/platform_server/#bug_fixing_11.11.2).

* Issue - Prototype pollution.
The jQuery version 1.8.3 is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution, [CVE-2019-11358](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11358). The extend function can be tricked into modifying the prototype of Object when the attacker controls part of the structure passed to this function. This can let an attacker add or modify an existing property that will then exist on all objects. You can find more information on the vulnerability [here](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006). While the jQuery version we ship with OutSystems is based on 1.8.3, OutSystems fixed this vulnerability in [PS 11.11.2](https://success.outsystems.com/support/release_notes/11/platform_server/#bug_fixing_11.11.2), and it doesn't contain any of the patterns described in the vulnerability description, for which this is considered a false positive.

* Issue - Passing HTML from untrusted sources to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods.
The jQuery versions 1.0.3 to 3.5.0 are vulnerable to the possible execution of untrusted code ([CVE-2020-11022](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11022) and [CVE-2020-11023](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11023)). While the jQuery version we ship with OutSystems is based on 1.8.3, the Platform Server doesn't generate code that passes HTML from untrusted sources to the JQuery DOM manipulation methods, for which this is considered a false positive.

#### jQuery-ui flagged as a potentially vulnerable library

The jQuery-UI versions prior to 1.13.0 are vulnerable to the execution of untrusted code ([CVE-2021-41182](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2021-41182), [CVE-2021-41183](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2021-41183), [CVE-2021-41184](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2021-41184) and [CVE-2016-7103](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2016-7103)). OutSystems uses jQuery-UI 1.8.24, which is exposed to this vulnerability. However, there is no usage of the patterns or parameters described in the CVEs, which makes the OutSystems applications not vulnerable.

The jQuery versions prior to 1.13.2 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability for the "checkboxradio" component ([CVE-2022-31160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2022-31160))  This component was not introduced in JQuery-UI until version 1.12.0.  OutSystems uses jQuery-UI 1.8.24, so OutSystems is not vulnerable.

#### jQuery-ui-dialog flagged as a potentially vulnerable library

Some penetration testing tools may flag OutSystems as having a vulnerable jQuery-ui-dialog library.

OutSystems uses jQuery-ui-dialog version 1.8.24, that has a vulnerability known to this version - [CVE-2010-5312](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-5312/). This vulnerability involves the title() function, which could potentially enable the insertion of unescaped content into the title, leading to a cross-site scripting problem.

All uses of the affected function were reviewed and fixed in PS [11.14.0](https://success.outsystems.com/support/release_notes/11/platform_server/#bug_fixing_platform_server_11.14.0). OutSystems properly encodes the input parameter. As such, OutSystems applications aren't vulnerable despite this vulnerability still being present in jquery-ui-dialog.

As for applications developed by the customer that make use of this library, you should ensure that you encode the input to the title() and dialog() functions correctly. Alternatively, you can import your own version of jquery-ui-dialog into a different namespace and use that version instead.

#### jQuery-ui-tooltip flagged as a potentially vulnerable library

Some penetration testing tools may flag OutSystems as having a vulnerable jQuery-ui-tooltip library - [CVE-2012-6662](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2012-6662).

OutSystems doesn't use jQuery-ui-tooltip widget. It's not present on our code.

#### Javascript source map (.js.map files) flagged as being exposed by the server

The .js.map files are used during debugging to unminify source code. These files themselves do not represent an attack vector since it's possible to recover the original source code and not find any bugs or vulnerabilities to exploit. The .js.map files are available in all environments except production, limiting their exposure.

#### IdentityServer4 flagged as a vulnerable library

The version of IdentityServer4 used by the OutSystems platform is vulnerable to [CVE-2024-39694](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-39694). The OutSystems Platform code is not affected by this vulnerability.

## Support from OutSystems

OutSystems support and security teams are ready to discuss the findings of the penetration tests with you under the following conditions:

* We expect that you do a preliminary analysis of the report, and report  the issues that are caused by the platform and/or cloud infrastructure to OutSystems support.
* The list of issues reported to OutSystems support should exclude issues that can be fixed by the developers or OutSystems admins by enforcing configurations.

Support's reply may include the following:

* A reasoned identification of false positives.
* A reasoned adjustment of severity based on the specifics of the technical environment.
* An escalation of eventual product defects to R&D.
