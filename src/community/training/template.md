# This is the page title

This is a template, it's not an article to be published. You can copy this file if you want to create a new article, but make sure you delete the content.

Right on top, encased in --- you have the page header. **It must always be present in any article**.
You can and should write a descriptive summary, but never edit locale, guid, and tags.

This is normal text. You can use links in text. [This is the text that will display in the link](https://www.this-is-the-url.example.com).

You can format text, here are some examples:

**this is bold text**: use it for options that show in the interface. You can also use it fo emphasis, but don't overuse it.

`this is code text`: use it to point values that users need to fill in. It's more suitable in the context of development. 

Underlined text? Nope, don't use it. Browsers use underline for links.

## This is a heading 2

Use heading for sections in the article. Don't overuse them, sometimes a list or a separate paragraph is enough.

Leave a space between lines to create a paragraph.

This is a bulleted list, use it to list items that don't have any specific order. Leave a blank line before stating the list:

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3

This is a numbered list, use it for steps that need to be executed in a specific order:
It may seem strange, but all the steps should be numbered as "1.":

1. Step 1

    You can write further text that belongs to that step. Leave a blank line in between and indent the text that belongs to the step with 4 spaces.

1. Step 2

    These are the instructions for step 2.

1. Step 3

### This is a heading 3

A heading 3 is a "child" of heading 2.

You can also use tables. Here's an example of a simple table that shows the OutSystems tools, and those that use them:

| Tool | Typical users |
| --- | --- |
| Service Studio | Developers |
| LifeTime | DevOps |
| Service Center | Admins and DevOps |
