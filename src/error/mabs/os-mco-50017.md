# OS-MCO-50017

## Error message

`An error occurred while modifying the config.xml. If the problem persists, open a support case.`

## Cause

An internal error occurred.

## Impact

The mobile compilation fails, causing the native mobile build to fail.

## Recommended action

This error can be due to invalid XML characters in the extensibility configurations of your mobile app or its libraries. Try removing these invalid characters to resolve the issue.

Please try the operation again. This might be a temporary issue that resolves on its own.

If the problem persists or the recommended action doesn't resolve the issue, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-MCO-50017).
