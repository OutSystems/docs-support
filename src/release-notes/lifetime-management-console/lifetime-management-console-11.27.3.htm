<ul>
<li>Extended the Environment Filters behaviour to screens where there is a list of the available environments to the user. Now, the filter applies to the 'Create deployment plan' popup and 'Environments' screen. This behaviour can be toggled in the LifeTime Settings screen under the section 'Environment Filters'. (R11CT-4117)</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused a 404 error when deploying a newly created application version via the LifeTime API. The error occurred if the application version was used immediately in a new deployment plan before the system had fully synchronized the information. This behavior has been corrected, and deployment plans can now be created using recently created application versions without issues.
