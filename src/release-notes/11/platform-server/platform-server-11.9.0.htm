<h2 id="platform_server_11.9.0" >Platform Server 11.9.0</h2>
<div class="info"><p>Released on Jul 28, 2020</p></div>

<h3 id="new_in_platform_server_11.9.0" >New in Platform Server 11.9.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved locking on IndexedDB allowing operations that use different entities to execute simultaneously. (RAR-142)</li>
<li>This version of Platform Server brings the early access feature "Configure mobile apps updates distribution" to manage how mobile apps update on user devices. After you activate the feature for all environments in LifeTime, control which of your apps receive updates only through the app store, and which apps receive hybrid updates. Look for the new DEPLOYMENT tab in the "Mobile app update preferences" step of a deployment plan. (RNMT-4223)</li>
<li>Added an option to only automatically refresh references during solution publish operations when there are broken references, instead of on any differences. Configurable using Factory Configuration. (RPC-1177)</li>
<li>Applications created with OutSystems now correctly identify and load all third-party library versions to prevent inconsistent runtime behaviors. (RRCT-2687)</li>
<li>Upgraded Microsoft.AspNetCore and Microsoft.Extension libraries to the latest 2.1 LTS (Long-Term Support) versions. (RRCT-2896)</li>
<li>Moved SAML-related actions from the Authentication extension to the new SAMLAuthentication extension. If you're using any SAML actions outside the Users module, we recommend that you add the SAMLAuthentication extension as a dependency and update all references to the Authentication extension. (RSAT-2104)</li>
<li>Added an option in SAML configuration to only accept signed login responses from the Identity Provider server. (RSBO-1535)</li>
<li>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are now generally available (GA), after a period of early access (EA). Create a mobile app, and then turn on the toggle "Distribute as PWA" in the Distribute tab. To create a mobile app, select either Phone or Tablet App in the dialog for a new app. (RTAFB-2977)</li>
</ul>

<li>OutSystems no longer generates three-part names in object definitions for SQL Azure. For more information check <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ssdt/windows-azure-importexport-service-and-external-references">Windows Azure Import/Export Service and External References</a> in Microsoft documentation.

<li>Fixed an issue that could cause Applications not to startup. (RPM-345)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the RabbitMQ client's automatic recovery would fail due to locked queue names. (RPM-379)</li>
<li>Improvements to the GetUserApplications query in the ApplicationSwitcher from RichWidgets in order to reduce the timeout or slow load time on Oracle stacks. (RPM-483)</li>
<li>Fixed a crash in the publishing step that was caused by invalid Theme names. (RPM-550)</li>

<li>Fixed a security vulnerability. CVSSv3.1 score 7.4 (High). (RTAFB-2226)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The platform now gives preference to usage of specific versions of third-party assemblies that are included in extensions. As a consequence, extensions that incorrectly include .NET Framework assemblies can prevent applications from working correctly due to conflicts between the included assemblies and the assemblies of the .NET Framework installed in the machine.
In particular, including the extensions System.Net.Http.dll or System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.dll causes issues in logging, login, and JSON serialization. (RPM-383) (RPM-386)
<br/>
Check how you can determine the affected extensions and how to adapt them to the new assembly loading behavior in <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/goto/breaking-changes-11#introduced-in-platform-server-1190" rel="internal">OutSystems 11 side effects and breaking changes</a>.</li>
<li>The KeyStore and SAML actions were moved from the Authentication extension, Authentication.xif, to the SAMLAuthentication extension, SAMLAuthentication.xif. This can cause some broken references when using methods from Authentication.xif that moved to the new module. (RSAT-2104)
<br/>
To fix this behavior, replace dependencies to KeyStore and SAML actions from Authentication to the corresponding actions from SAMLAuthentication.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deploying a Mobile App from an environment where you enabled the toggle "Distribute as PWA" doesn't automatically enable the same toggle in the target environment. The toggle in the target environment keeps its pre-deployment value. The runtime behavior of these apps may also be affected if the apps are opened in a browser, using PWA or Preview in Devices. You must manually activate the toggle "Distribute as PWA" for the Mobile App in the target environment.</li>
</ul>
