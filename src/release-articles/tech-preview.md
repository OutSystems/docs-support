# Technical Preview features

OutSystems gives you access to features in Technical Preview. These are specific features that allow you to enjoy new development possibilities and plan your future development sooner without upgrading to a major version.

We encourage you to try them out and [send us your feedback](https://www.outsystems.com/forums/71/early-access-features). These features are released much more frequently, in smaller chunks, and before theyâ€™re generally available. Given their nature, be aware of the following:

* These features aren't production-ready and may have limited functionality.
* They're disabled by default and you need to explicitly opt-in and activate them manually.
* OutSystems doesn't provide support for these features.
* Features in Technical Preview may change significantly or even be removed.

Starting from LifeTime Release May.2019, you can enjoy these features before they're generally available. In LifeTime, toggle the switch to **ON** to activate the feature you want to use.

You must have the "Manage Infrastructure and Users" infrastructure permission to enable or disable features in Technical Preview.

In the OutSystems Cloud, you'll find **Technical Preview** under **Environment** > **Options**.

For self-managed installations, Technical Preview is at **Infrastructure** > **Technical Preview**.
