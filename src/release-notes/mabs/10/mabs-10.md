## Breaking Changes

Here is the list of changes made to MABS 10 that may affect the building of your apps.

* The legacy Android Support Libraries (`com.android.support`) are no longer supported. Builds containing these libraries will fail until they are migrated to [their respective AndroidX counterpart](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate/artifact-mappings). Owners of non-supported plugins using Android Support Libraries must migrate their plugins to work with MABS 10. (RNMT-6187)
* Removed functionality that was specifically adding `aps-environments` to plist when present in the provisioning profile. This should be handled by each plugin making use of the `aps-environment` entitlement, and not generically by MABS since not all applications need this. (RNMT-5935)
