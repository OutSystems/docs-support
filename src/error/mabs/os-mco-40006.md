# OS-MCO-40006

## Error message

`Extensibility Configurations of <AssetName> must use a newer schema when targeting <MobileFramework>.`

## Cause

Capacitor-based apps require you to use Universal Extensibility in all its assets, where extensibility configurations are defined, such as your mobile app and all libraries it depends on.

## Impact

The mobile compilation fails, causing the native mobile build to fail.

## Recommended action

Update the assets that use Cordova-based Extensibility to use Universal Extensibility instead. Keep in mind that enabling full Capacitor support may require more than just updating the schema. For instance, Cordova preferences that [configure app behaviors](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/config_ref/index.html#preference) aren’t applicable to Capacitor apps. Similarly, certain elements defined in the `plugin.xml` file of Cordova plugins, such as hooks, aren’t supported in Capacitor.

Alternatively, you can remove the libraries that use Cordova-based Extensibility from your mobile app, or continue using Cordova as the mobile framework until the migration to Capacitor is complete.

If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-MCO-40006).
