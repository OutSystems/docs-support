<ul>
<li>Dashboard Composition: Generate dashboards that are use case tailored, relevant, and useful, of course all the while keeping our UX principles and guidelines for the generated apps intact. While respecting the user's intent described in the prompt or requirements document, Mentor is now generating different UI patterns (counters, filters, in multiple layouts) and different charts types to better display the relevant.
<ul>
<li>Example of prompt:Create an Expense Tracker App where Finance team needs to monitor which types of expenses have higher costs and the cost of each department. Expenses can be in Submitted, Approved or Rejected. It must include a Dashboard with a chart showing expenses by category, a counter for total expenses, a chart to display employee expense breakdowns by department, and counters to show per approval status the total expenses in the last 5 days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UI Diversity Enhancements: We've introduced a new Master-Detail pattern for generated screens that combines list and detail views in a single screen, providing a more efficient browsing experience for certain types of data.
<ul>
<li>Example of prompt to trigger Master-Detail: Create an app for order management, where I can also quickly see the details of each product and the contact details of each provider</li>
<li>Example of prompt to not trigger Master-Detail: Create an app for order management, where I can have a screen with a table of all products and the list of all providers</li>
</li>
