<li>Weâ€™re introducing three new connectors at Data Fabric - Azure AI Search, AWS Kendra AI, and Custom AI Search - that enable developers to integrate AI-powered search services into their applications. These connectors allow applications to leverage intelligent search capabilities, improving information retrieval and enhancing user experiences with more relevant results. The Custom AI Search connector also allows developers to connect to other search services of their choice. (RDCIST-2661)</li>
