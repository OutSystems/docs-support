# Vulnerability RPD-2322

## Overview

OutSystems became aware of a vulnerability that, if exploited, may allow an attacker to compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data handled and stored by the OutSystems Platform.

OutSystems does not have any indication or reason to believe that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.

### Technology stacks

This vulnerability affects all supported Platform stacks. 

### Communication
To understand the phases involved in the process, how and when we communicate, [check this article](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Security/Vulnerabilities).

   * **Embargo phase**: This vulnerability was first communicated to all customers on January 15, 2018
   * **Public disclosure**: Full details on this vulnerability were disclosed.

### Vulnerability details
A security flaw was identified in one of the Service Center API endpoints. It allows any unauthenticated user with network access to Service Center to use the internal undocumented PingAddress API endpoint to instruct the Platform to perform HTTP GET requests to arbitrary addresses. By exploiting this flaw an attacker can use Service Center as a proxy to perform HTTP requests to an arbitrary address, while masking the source IP address. In extreme cases this flaw can crash the application server, causing the Platform to be unavailable.

OutSystems PaaS infraestructures do not require any workaround as they were all patched and are protected.
