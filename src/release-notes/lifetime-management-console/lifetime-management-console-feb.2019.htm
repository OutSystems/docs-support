<ul>
<li>Improved LifeTime cleanup process to also remove unused data from completed stagings. (RLIT-2287)</li>
<li>Added change log information to the output structure "ApplicationVersion" for methods "GET /applications/{ApplicationKey}/versions/" and "GET /applications/{ApplicationKey}/versions/{VersionKey}/" in LifeTime Deployment API v2. Added also the optional input "ChangeLogFilter" to method "GET /applications/{ApplicationKey}/versions/" to filter the returned list of versions by change logs containing the required keyword. (RLIT-2395)</li>
<li>It is now possible to delete application versions (LifeTime tags) using the new method "DELETE /applications/{ApplicationKey}/versions/{VersionKey}/" of LifeTime Deployment API v2. This feature will allow to delete in the environments the old module versions previously tagged by LifeTime. It requires Platform Server 10.0.912.0 (OutSystems 10 environments) or Platform Server 11 - Release Sep.2018 Cumulative Patch 1 (OutSystems 11 environments). Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/3562/">Harlin Setiadarma's idea</a>. (RLIT-2399)</li>
<li>A new API method is now available in LifeTime Deployment API v2 for downloading the .oap file of a specific application version, "GET /applications/{ApplicationKey}/versions/{VersionKey}/content/". This method can be used to backup the code of an application version before deleting it. It requires Platform Server 10.0.1005.0 (OutSystems 10 environments) or Platform Server 11 - Release Jan.2019 Cumulative Patch 1 (OutSystems 11 environments). (RLIT-2169)</li>
<li>Added new input "TargetEnvironmentKey" to the API method "GET /deployments/" of LifeTime Deployment API v1 and v2 that allows to filter the deployments list by target environment. Improved also the return codes to differ the case when the user does not have permissions to view the requested deployments from the case when there are no deployments that match the search. (RLIT-2368)</li>
<li>In LifeTime Deployment API v2, the attribute “ModuleVersionKeys” of structure "ApplicationVersionCreate" has been deprecated and is now optional. When creating a new application version using the method "POST /environments/{EnvironmentKey}/applications/{ApplicationKey}/versions/", passing a value in attribute “ModuleVersionKeys” will behave as previously, validating the module versions. (RLIT-2369)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in API method "POST /environments/{EnvironmentKey}/applications/{ApplicationKey}/versions/" of LifeTime Deployment API v2 that was preventing the creation of mobile apps versions. (RLIT-2410)</li>
