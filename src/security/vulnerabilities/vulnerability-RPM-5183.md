## Vulnerability summary

[AppFeedback](https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=7679b3a4-2a80-4ddf-9e85-e470c8af8428) was vulnerable to script injection.

## Affected products

* Platform Server

### Vulnerable products and versions

This vulnerability affects all versions of the Platform Server.

## Vulnerability details

Some parameters of the endpoints used by [AppFeedback](https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=7679b3a4-2a80-4ddf-9e85-e470c8af8428) were not correctly escaped and were vulnerable to script injection. Although the "attack" could be done while submitting the feedback, it can only be exploited while [handling the submitted feedback](https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=b8db2ed6-0551-41c8-b16d-3063670c0417).

The exploit occurs when a user responsible for managing feedback opens submitted feedback to review it. This action can trigger execution of the injected code, potentially causing harm.

## Workarounds

In order to mitigate the issue, OutSystems advises our customers to:

1. Disable the app feedback (this will prevent any feedback from being collected and by itself does not prevent the vulnerability from being exploited).

1. Continue to collect feedback but prevent AppFeedback backoffice users from viewing the feedback (here is where the vulnerability can be exploited) by removing users' FeedbackManager role. **This should be mandatory to prevent the vulnerability from being exploited**. Note that an Administrator can log into the AppFeedback Backoffice so they should be instructed not to do it).


## Fixed products and versions

* Platform Server version 11.31.0
  
OutSystems issued released Platform Server 11.31.0 that addresses this vulnerability. All subsequent releases will be protected. 

If you have a self-managed infrastructure we strongly encourage upgrading to the latest release.


## Exploitation and public announcements

The OutSystems Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) has been able to reproduce the vulnerability proving it can be exploited.
