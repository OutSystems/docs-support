<h1>Mobile App version is not editable in Test Stages</h1>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Symptoms</strong>: Unable to modify the version of a mobile package in Test Stages</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>When you are <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/building_apps/mobile_apps/create_mobile_app_package/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating a mobile app package</a>, ODC will suggest the application's version number (Major, Minor, Patch) as well as the Version Code, which is a number that increments by one every time MABS generates a new package. Both of these values are editable in the Development and Production stages:</p>

</p>
<p>What you may notice is that, when you try to edit this value in a Test Stage, the option to edit these values is missing:</p>

</p>
<p>If this is the behavior you're running into, proceed to Incident Resolution Measures.</p>
<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>
<p data-start="72" data-end="321">This behavior is expected by our versioning mechanism; when you are creating a mobile package in a Test Stage, the mechanism automatically suggests a version number. If you have no packages generated in the Production Stage, then the default suggestion for Test Stages is 0.1.0.</p>
<p data-start="72" data-end="321">On the other hand, if you have already created packages in your Production Stage, then the suggestion will always increment on top of that. As an example:</p>
<ul>
    <li data-start="721" data-end="1049">If the current Production package is 0.1.0, the next suggested version in the Test Stage will be 0.1.1;</li>
    <li data-start="971" data-end="1049">If the current Production package is 1.0.0, the next suggested version in the Test Stage will be 1.0.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>These version values are exclusively used for Tracking purposes, since builds in a Test Stage should not be production-ready; on the other hand, builds in Production may be expected to be released in app stores, so proper version control is necessary there.</p>
