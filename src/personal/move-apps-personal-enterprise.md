# Move apps from your Personal Edition to an Enterprise Edition

You can transfer applications when you upgrade from a Personal Edition to a paid subscription.

After you subscribe to an OutSystems Enterprise Edition, go to our Support Portal and request the transfer of your applications, providing your Personal Environment email and your subscription Activation Code.

**FAQs:**

*Can I transfer more apps from my Personal Edition in the future?*

Following the terms of use for the Personal Edition, you can share your apps with the Community, through the Forge. If you do not intend to share your apps with the Community, develop them in your paid Enterprise Edition. OutSystems evaluates each transfer request, and only considers one request for each new customer.
