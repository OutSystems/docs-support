# OS-DP-STREAM-00014

## Error message

`There was an error trying to reach your destination server.`

## Cause

The error occurs when testing the connection after [Configuring the log streaming service in LifeTime](https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=172ac547-add4-4cc5-9adf-d72fbe379d35) or when checking Log Streaming health and the destination server has responded with gRPC 14 (Unavailable) error.

## Impact

Unable to establish a connection with the destination server. Therefore, logs aren't streamed to the destination.

## Recommended action

In LifeTime Log Streaming, review the destination server configuration. Verify if the server URL is valid and correct.
