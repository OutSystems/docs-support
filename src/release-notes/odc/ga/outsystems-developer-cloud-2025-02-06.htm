<ul>
<li>Previously, when a user logged into an application published across multiple stages using external identity providers with different group-to-role mappings in each stage, only the mapped role from the most recent login was retained. This could cause loss of roles mapped during previous logins to other stages. With this fix, users' mapped roles are preserved across all stages they log into, ensuring consistent access and functionality. (RDPIDT-2888)</li>
</ul>
