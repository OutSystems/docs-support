# OS-MCO-40010

## Error message

`Multiple AppShield plugin sources are present in the Extensibility Configurations. Use only one version of AppShield in the app.`

## Cause

Your mobile app includes multiple versions of OutSystems AppShield, but only one version can be used per app. This issue typically occurs when you've cloned or modified the OutSystems AppShield library.

## Impact

The mobile compilation fails, causing the native mobile build to fail.

## Recommended action

Don't clone or modify the OutSystems AppShield library, as this can negatively impact your app or cause native mobile build failures.

If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-MCO-40010).
