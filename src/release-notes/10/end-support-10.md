# End of mainstream support for OutSystems 10

OutSystems continually delivers new capabilities to help customers innovate and differentiate, building enterprise-grade apps that adapt as fast as business demands. To focus our engineering resources on those innovative capabilities, we establish a cut-off date to end support for older code. These cut-off dates are typically two to three years after the launch of a major version. **The end of mainstream support for OutSystems Platform 10 (O10) was on May 31, 2020**.

At February 28, 2020, OutSystems announced an extended support period for OutSystems 10 that would started on May 31, 2020 and lasted until August 31, 2020. OutSystems is following closely the COVID-19 development and how it affects companies worldwide. More than ever, stability is crucial. And as usual, we commit to doing whatever is possible to help you ensure that your business is running smoothly and steadily. Therefore, we decided to **further increase the duration of the extended support phase for OutSystems 10 until December 31, 2020**.

## What does this mean?

OutSystems technical support team will continue to help you when you submit support requests. After the end of mainstream support, if a bug is the problem, technical support’s response won't include a bug fix. In this scenario, problem-solving will include advice and workarounds. To avoid this situation, we recommend upgrading to a supported version.

Start planning your company’s upgrade to OutSystems 11. By upgrading to OutSystems 11, you'll benefit from the enhanced capabilities of the newest OutSystems releases and continue taking advantage of OutSystems support and maintenance. To help you design an effective upgrade strategy, we’ve published an [OutSystems upgrade guide](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Upgrading/01_Upgrade_OutSystems_Platform). If you have any questions about this announcement, please contact your OutSystems Partner or account manager.

## OutSystems Cloud

If you are on the OutSystems Cloud, a timely upgrade is mandatory. 

The majority of OutSystems Cloud customers in OutSystems 10 will be able to benefit from this extension right away. However, customers in OutSystems Cloud using Oracle may need to update earlier, since AWS announced the end of Oracle 11 and 12c support, which are the database versions currently supported by OutSystems 10. A plan was rolled out to minimize the impact on those infrastructures and ensure  they benefit from the extension and have a smooth transition to OutSystems 11.

If you are still running on OutSystems 10, OutSystems scheduled compulsory upgrades to your OutSystems Cloud environments after that date. We've notified you with the update schedule 30 days in advance. The upgrade schedule will detail the timeline for the upgrade of all your non-production environments and the upgrade of your databases.

To minimize the impact on your software development activities, we recommend you to anticipate the upgrade schedule to convenient dates.

## Who upgrades the environments?

he upgrade responsibility depends on the type of installation: self-managed, OutSystems Cloud, or hybrid.

### OutSystems Cloud

If you have your installation on the OutSystems Cloud, carefully review [how to upgrade the OutSystems Platform in the OutSystems Cloud](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Upgrading/01_Upgrade_OutSystems_Platform), then please contact support to schedule the upgrade. OutSystems support upgrades the infrastructure and platform. There are however additional upgrade activities that you're responsible for, such as assessing the impact of the upgrade on your applications and upgrading these applications.

### Self-managed

If you have a self-managed installation, you are responsible for the upgrade process. OutSystems can provide upgrade services (at a cost) if you wish to have individualized assistance from our OutSystems services team. You may contact your account manager or OutSystems partner for details on the upgrade services offering. You can find more information on [how to upgrade OutSystems Platform](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Upgrading/01_Upgrade_OutSystems_Platform).

### Hybrid

If you have a hybrid deployment model that combines self-managed and OutSystems Cloud environments, we have scheduled your OutSystems  Cloud environments to be upgraded before the end of extended support.


## Java and MySQL

A few customers are running OutSystems on Java, or using MySQL as their platform database, and have a specific support plan.

### OutSystems 10 support calendar for Java 

As the OutSystems platform evolves to match tomorrow’s technology stacks, we stopped to invest in traditional Java application servers.
OutSystems discussed individually with each customer the best stack evolution plan and will be helping customers with this transition. 
Mainstream support continues until **the end of 2021** for customers running OutSystems on Java application servers.

### OutSystems 10 support calendar for MySQL 

OutSystems 11 continues to support MySQL as an external database, allowing OutSystems applications to work seamlessly on data managed in MySQL external databases.
On the other hand, OutSystems 11 no longer supports MySQL as a platform database.
OutSystems has discussed individually with each customer the best database evolution plan and will be helping customers with this transition.
Mainstream support continues until **the end of 2021** for customers running OutSystems with MySQL as their platform database.
