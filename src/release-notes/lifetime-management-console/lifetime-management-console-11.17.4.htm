<li>Fixed an issue that would prevent a self-serviced environment from being removed from Cloud Backoffice if it was already removed from the infrastructure.
This would occur in PaaS scenarios with a hybrid infrastructure when trying to remove an environment that could not be reached.
Now, the user can continue the process and remove the environment from Cloud Backoffice. (R11CT-2259)</li>
<li>Now, when configuring the OpenId Connect provider in LifeTime, required scopes can be added from the identity provider supported scope list. This feature enhancement removes the dependency of having the identity provider to support offline_access scope as mandatory and enables the OutSystems platform to allow a wide range of OIDC enabled external identity providers. (RPOR-17542)</li>

<ul>
<li>Occasionally, the state of a deployment plan may become undefined because of an unexpected event (for instance, a time-out, because the solution publish operation takes too long) and if one were to attempt to re-execute the plan, you would get an error stating that there is an already ongoing publish operation. This would persist until the solution publish finished in the target environment. Now, the user experience has been improved by updating accurately the state of the deployment plan as well as informing the IT user that the solution publish operation of the initial attempt is still ongoing. This fix requires Platform Server version 11.23.1 or higher to be installed in the target environment of the deployment plan.

<h3>Note</h3>
<ul>
<li>In this LifeTime version, manual installation of Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 is required. The checklist bundled with the installer doesn't include the necessary steps for that. We acknowledge that this is a known issue, please <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/Downloads/ScreenDetails.aspx?MajorVersion=11&ReleaseId=21171&ComponentName=LifeTime">download the checklist from our website</a> that includes the steps for the manual installation of Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022. </li>
