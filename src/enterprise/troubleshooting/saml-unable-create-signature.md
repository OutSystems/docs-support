# Unable to create SAML signature

## Symptoms

You configured end-user authentication [to use SAML](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/developing_an_application/secure_the_application/end_users/end_users_authentication/configure_saml_2.0_authentication/) and you get the following error when the end users attempt to logout: ``Unable to process request. Unable to create SAML signature``.

## Cause

Due to [Personal environment hosting infrastructure under the hood](https://success.outsystems.com/support/licensing/personal_environment_hosting_infrastructure_under_the_hood/) and security constraints, this error is thrown during the logout.
