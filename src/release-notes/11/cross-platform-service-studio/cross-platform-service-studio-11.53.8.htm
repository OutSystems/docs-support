<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in the high code editors, in which the usage of the Shift+Enter shortcut would close those editors' dialogs. Also fixed the Ctrl+Enter shortcut usage on macOS for the same high code editors, not closing the dialogs anymore - on this Operative System the proper confirmation shortcut is âŒ˜+Enter. (RMAC-8502)</li>
