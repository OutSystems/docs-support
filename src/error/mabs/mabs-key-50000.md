# OS-MABS-KEY-50000

## Error message

`Something happened on our side while packaging your app. Please try again.`

## Cause

This error occurs when MABS fails to create the signing assets in the build process.

## Impact

Users can't generate the application package.

## Recommended action

Validate the correctness of your signing assets and try to repeat the operation and check the build logs on Service Center.
