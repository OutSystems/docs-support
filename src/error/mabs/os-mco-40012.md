# OS-MCO-40012

## Error message

`Value for AppShield configuration <ConfigName> can't be a placeholder.`

## Cause

The AppShield configuration mentioned in the error uses an extensibility settings placeholder, but this specific configuration doesn't support placeholders.

## Impact

The mobile compilation fails, causing the native mobile build to fail.

## Recommended action

Find the AppShield configuration mentioned in the error message in the extensibility configurations of your mobile app or its libraries and replace the placeholder with a concrete value. Remember that the configuration might be set in multiple assets simultaneously.

If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-MCO-40012).
