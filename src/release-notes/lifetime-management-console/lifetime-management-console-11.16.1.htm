<ul>
<li>Now when adding applications to a deployment plan, a warning icon is displayed to let the user know that the default staging option suggested by LifeTime has a different tag from the one currently published in the source environment. (RPM-947) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_lifetime_management_console_11.16.1" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a solution publish operation issue where more than one publish request was triggered to the target environment when a timeout occurred in the publish process. (RPM-1525) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the suspension of the synchronization process of the environments which would lead to problems when executing subsequent operations such as deployments, and setting configurations, among others. 
This occurred in infrastructures with multiple applications that weren't deployed in every environment. The suspension was due to too many requests inside the process.
The issue was fixed in an internal query that will avoid the excessive number of requests that led to the suspension. (RPM-2117) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue which prevented a user with 'Change and Deploy' permissions over an environment to access the 'Settings' link in the Application_Details of an application from that environment. (RPM-2210) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issued that caused MoveData_RequestFact stored procedure to fail on Oracle.
This occurred when old LifeTimeAnalytics tables don't exist, the process was related to an old data migration process that is now removed. (RPM-2869) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the user to be unable to register new environments in LifeTime due to lack of permissions. (RPM-3072) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Added new the auditing logs when the environment security settings are changed. Now each setting has a dedicated audit message indicating what has changed. (RPM-3205) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue with wrong audit message. In a cloud infrastructure, when changing the Maintenance Window of an environment the logged message had the wrong environment name and the user who made the request wasn't recorded. (RPM-3207) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed the issue that was causing the Username claim field to display default value always even when it was changed and saved. (RPM-3458) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that was not letting to enable legacy provider with Built-in authentication activated and throwing error. (RPM-3471) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an error when a user had Access permissions in the environment but Change&Deploy in a specific Application.<br/> 
This occurred when LifeTime would add a dependency of that app that the user has no permission to deploy.<br/>
Now, the user will get an exception saying that he does not have permission to deploy one or more of the added dependencies. (RPM-672) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Made the automatic abort due to errors on deployment plans more resilient.
In some situations, when an abort due to errors occurs in a deployment plan, it can end in an inconsistent state that can prevent other deployment plans to be created.
Now, even if the activity with error is skipped, the staging will be correctly marked as finished. (RPM-829) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a security issue that could allow access to server information. CVSSv3.1 score 6.3 (Medium). (RPM-3142) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>When clicking Save at the Environment Security page in Service Center (Administration > Security), a warning to "Save and Apply Settings to the Factory" may wrongly appear.  For example, if you have only changed the "Enhanced security for Remoting requests", the message to "Save and Apply Settings to the Factory" may appear but it's not necessary to apply settings.
This will happen when the default values for  Secure and SameSite Cookies are used.</li>
<li>For the IT Users authentication, if any Legacy provider (LDAP, AD, or any custom authentication provider) is already active and then an OpenId Connect Provider is activated (or vice-versa), LifeTime displays both the Legacy provider and the OpenId Connect provider as active. Said that, the authentication works properly with whichever provider is activated last. Though there is no impact on the functionality, visually this might be confusing to identify the active provider.
To avoid this situation, if either the Legacy provider or the OpenId Connect provider is active and the other one is to be activated, activating Built-in authentication first will have all the previous activation disabled and then the intended provider then can be activated without any visual issue.
If the issue is hit, the workaround is to activate the Built-in authentication and then activating back the OpenId Connect provider or the Legacy provider, whichever is intended.</li>
<li>While navigating between the OpenId Connect provider and the Legacy provider (LDAP, AD, or any custom authentication provider) tabs, the information section does not update accordingly in the right panel. Doing a browser refresh or selecting Built-in authentication tab before selecting any of the other provider tabs resolves this issue.</li>
