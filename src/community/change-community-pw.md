Note:

* After you reset your password, wait 2 to 3 minutes before trying to sign in. It takes some time for the password from Community Profile to sync with the Personal Environment.

* Due to security reasons, avoid signing in with the password that doesn't work. After a certain number of wrong attempts to sign in, your account is blocked for the duration of one hour. The 1-hour lock remains even after you reset your password.
