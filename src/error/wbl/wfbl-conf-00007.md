## Error message

`Cannot create Group: <OriginalErrorMessage>.`

## Cause

This error occurs when you try to create a group and for some members of the group, the operation fails.
The &lt;OriginalErrorMessage&gt; includes information about the cause of the error. 

## Impact

Workflow Builder can't save the Group defined, therefore that group can't be used in the application workflow.

## Recommended action

Try to repeat the operation. If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems support](https://success.outsystems.com/Support).
