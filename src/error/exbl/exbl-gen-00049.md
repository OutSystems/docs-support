# OS-EXBL-GEN-00049

## Error message

`There was an error loading the flow. Exit and re-enter the app to continue.`

## Cause

An internal error occurred.

## Impact

You aren't able to correctly view the application.

## Recommended action

Be sure to refresh the page. You can do that by leaving and re-entering the app.

You can also check the available options for replacing the flow. If the options do not remain there, the app metadata is outdated. If you choose one of the options and the error still persists, it's most likely an internal error. In that case, please create a case with [OutSystems support](https://success.outsystems.com/Support).
