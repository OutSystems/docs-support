# OS-MABS-SIG-40004

## Error message

`This certificate has an unknown file format.`

## Cause

This error occurs when generating an iOS app and MABS isn't able to parse the certificate file.

## Impact

Users can't generate the application package.

## Recommended action

Check if the certificate has the correct format (only `.p12` extension is valid). Otherwise, replace it and retry.
