<ul>
<li>Added a new permission, "Add References to System", to configure who can add new dependencies to public elements of System module. This permission is applicable when granted in the user default role. (RLIT-3160) (RLIT-3160)</li>
<li>We have split the permission level “Reuse and Monitor Applications” into two permission levels, “Open and Debug Applications” and “Monitor and Reference Applications”. This way you have a more granular permission model, as you can now give permission to monitor applications without the permission to open and debug. During the upgrade, the previous role “Reuse and Monitor Applications” is mapped to “Open and Debug Applications”. (RLIT-2804)</li>
<li>Added a new permission, "Create Applications", to configure who can create applications and associate them directly to a team. During the upgrade, this new permission is set to ON for the roles having “Change Deploy Applications” permission level. (RLIT-2796)</li>
<li>Added a new permission level, “Access to Environment”, which allows users to log in to an environment without the permission to see the applications. (RLIT-2790)</li>
</ul>
