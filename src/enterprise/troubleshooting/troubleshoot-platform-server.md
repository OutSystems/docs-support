# Troubleshooting the OutSystems Platform Server

<div class="info" markdown="1">

This article applies to self-managed OutSystems installations.

</div>

This article describes known techniques for troubleshooting OutSystems Platform Server in the presence of system malfunction. You will learn how to obtain error information and, for every known error, what was the cause and which recovery actions should be taken.

## How to obtain error information

Effective error tracking, monitoring and alert strategies can be put in practice using the standard OutSystems Platform Server configuration.

Error tracking is achieved via Service Center, accessing Monitoring tab. Check [here](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Managing_the_Applications_Lifecycle/Monitor_and_Troubleshoot/View_the_Environment_Logs_and_Status#Monitoring_Area) the details about each screen of the Monitoring area.

The same information can be accessed directly in the OutSystems Log Database, accessing data in tables named as *os_log_log_kind_n *(e.g. *os_log_screen_1*). Due to rotation purposes, there are 10 distinct tables for each kind of log. Nevertheless, a specific view exists for current data, as presented in Service Center. These views are named, simply as *os_log_log_kind*.

Error alerts are based on the Windows Event Viewer entries. The OutSystems Platform Server produces Windows Event Viewer entries in the Application Log every time a severe error condition or every time any other type of error occurs several times in a period of time. Error alerts are issued based on its source and description.

## Windows Performance Counters

OutSystems Platform Server produces its own performance information, compliant with the Microsoft Windows System Performance Monitor, thus allowing integrated system performance monitoring in every Server. Along with common CPU, memory and hard disk access information, OutSystems Platform Performance Monitor provides accurate information about:

* Asynchronous Jobs Execution

* Application Error Rates

* Web and Mobile Web Screen Access

* Web Service Access
