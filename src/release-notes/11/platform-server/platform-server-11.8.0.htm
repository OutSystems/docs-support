<h2 id="platform_server_11.8.0">Platform Server 11.8.0</h2>
<div class="info">Released on Apr 13, 2020</div>
<h3 id="new_in_platform_server_11.8.0">New in Platform Server 11.8.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a progress bar to Service Center operation pages, such as publish or apply settings, in order to improve the visibility of the progress and status of the operation. (RLIT-3565)</li>
<li>Reviewed the sections for granting security levels to Users or Roles in several screens, improving the copy and pattern used.  (RLIT-3119)</li>
<li>Upgraded Oracle Driver to Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.Core version 2.19.60. (RPC-825)</li>
<li>Updated MySQL driver to version 8.0.18. (RPD-4645)</li>
<li>The built-in Service Studio tutorial (Help &gt; Build an App in 5 min) now shows how to use the <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Developing_an_Application/Implement_Application_Logic/AI-assisted_development" rel="internal">suggestions by the AI-assisted development feature</a>. (RAID-484)</li>
<li>The configuration of Deployment Zones is now only available at application level. Applications with modules in different deployment zones are still supported but this is a deprecated configuration, which we will drop in the future. If you have applications with modules in different deployment zones, you must refactor and reorganize them to meet this restriction. (RLIT-3574)</li>
<li>Now you can use the new "Apply Settings to the Factory" button in Service Center to set runtime settings of an Environment, instead of creating and publishing a Solution containing all Modules.<br/>
You'll also see a new warning in the sidebar whenever the environment has pending configurations. (RLIT-3632)</li>
<li>The QR Code now uses AppKey, instead of AppName, to generate the Application link. (ROU-890)</li>
<li>Improved error handling in threads created by OutSystems services to prevent potential crashes in error scenarios. (RPC-757)</li>
<li>You can now use SAML 2.0 authentication in your Reactive Web Apps. (RSBO-1318)</li>
<li>Now you can use Radio Button Widget in your Reactive Web and Mobile apps. To build and deploy an app with this widget in UI, you also need to update Service Studio and OutSystems UI. (RTAF-2143)</li>
<li>Now you can use Human Activity Destination property in Reactive Web Apps. (RTAF-2304)</li>
<li>We fixed the reloading of screens while navigating back in Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps. This was caused by a glitch in the way the apps handle the list of visited pages, in particular the Screens marked as default. (RTAF-2328)</li>
<li>We improved the preview of the Table Widget. The Table now displays more example records and you can hide/show the rows. (RTAF-1789)</li>
<li>Local storage for PWAs now takes advantage of IndexedDB. IndexedDB ensures better compatibility with modern browsers. IMPORTANT: The change of the database engine deletes the browser app data in your existing PWAs. If you notice runtime issues in PWAs, delete the site storage for the app domain. (RTAF-1188)</li>
<li>We implemented the single sign-on (SSO) for Traditional, Reactive Web and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). Your users now sign in to one app and switch to the other apps without having to sign in again. (RTAF-1874)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="known_issues_11.8.0">Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li> Publishing Mobile apps that use local storage may take longer than usual or fail due to a timeout.<br/>
The runtime behavior of these apps may also be affected if the apps are opened in a browser, using PWA or Preview in Devices.<br/>
To overcome this issue, use <a class="link-https" href="https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/25/factory-configuration" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Factory Configuration</a> to disable "IndexedDB For Local Storage data on PWAs/Browsers".</li>
</ul>
