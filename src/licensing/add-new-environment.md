# Add a new environment to your infrastructure

To add a new environment to your infrastructure, first contact your sales representative to discuss the requirements for the new environment and the details about obtaining an additional license.

For Cloud customers **OutSystems** will process your order, set up the new environment, and notify you by email when the new environment is available for use. 

For on-premises installations:

1. Prepare the new environment. See [Setting Up OutSystems](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setting_Up_OutSystems#On-Premises) for more information.
1. Install the license in your new environment. See [Self-Managed environments](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Licensing/Manage_and_Upgrade/03_Get_a_license_file_for_an_environment#Self-managed_environments) for complete instructions.
1. Register the environment on your infrastructure. See [Configure the infrastructure management console](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setting_Up_OutSystems/Configure_the_infrastructure_management_console) for complete instructions.

Customers with a Hybrid configuration should contact [technical support](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/01_Contact_OutSystems_technical_support) for instructions about how to add a new environment.
