# Inspect network traffic

Use network traffic inspection when you need to examine the details of network requests generated by your mobile app and the responses sent back to the app.

For example, you can check what resources load on your first visit, monitor the over the air update process of a mobile app, or simulate intermittent or slow network conditions.

## Network traffic inspection options

To inspect network traffic in your apps, you can use the following options:

* Chrome or Safari Developer Tools

* Network proxy tools:

    * **[HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.com/)** - Free and open-source tool for Android and iOS, for debugging, testing, and building with HTTP(S). HTTP Toolkit provides one-click mobile app interception for both Android and iOS devices, with features including:
        * Automatic HTTPS interception with zero configuration
        * Full request and response inspection
        * Request breakpoints and editing
        * Mock responses for testing

    * **[Mitmweb](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/tools-mitmweb/)** - This tool is the best free option but requires the most setup. You can follow these guides for setup - [Android](https://medium.com/@williamxyz/monitoring-network-on-android-with-mitmproxy-bfb8722191ee), [iOS](https://www.outsystems.com/forums/discussion/53691/how-to-troubleshoot-network-requests-in-ios-mabs-6-builds/).

    * **[Charles](https://www.charlesproxy.com/)** - Web debugging proxy app (Windows, macOS, Linux - also available for iOS)

## Simulate degraded network conditions

Use network condition simulation to investigate bugs that occur only intermittently or under poor network conditions. Chrome Developer Tools allow you to simulate slow networks, while a tool like Charles also allows you to simulate an unreliable network (dropping packets).

### Chrome developer tools

When inspecting an Android mobile app using the Chrome Developer Tools:

1. Connect your device and [start Android debug bridge (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).
1. In the **Network** tab, change the network profile to use one of the predefined presets, or create your own custom network profile.

### Charles proxy

The Charles tool offers [bandwidth throttling and reliability settings](https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/proxying/throttling/) to simulate different network conditions.

### iOS network link conditioner

For iOS mobile apps with XCode installed on a Mac, you can enable the developer options on the iOS device:

1. Open **Settings** on your iOS device.
1. Select **Developer** (this option appears after enabling developer mode).
1. Enable **Network Link Conditioner**.
1. Select from various predefined network profiles, or create your own custom network profiles.
