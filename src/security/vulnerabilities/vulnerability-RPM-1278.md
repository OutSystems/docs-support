## Workarounds

All workarounds are highly infrastructure dependent, for which we recommend hardening of:
* RabbitMQ installation folder permissions 
* Network access. Based on the [OutSystems network requirements](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setting_Up_OutSystems/OutSystems_network_requirements), port 5672 must only be available for access of infrastructure assets. Public access to the given port, or any other port used for the Cache Invalidation Service must be restricted from the Internet.

## Fixed products and versions

OutSystems issued the following releases that address this vulnerability.
### Platform Server
* 11.13.2

### LifeTime
* 11.10.4 

We strongly encourage self-managed installations to be updated to the latest version. 

OutSystems Cloud infrastructures are not affected, due to infrastructural configurations.
