<h3 id="new_in_outsystems_developer_cloud_2023-10-24" > New</h3>
<ul>
<li>Small UX tweaks and improvements on the deployments console. Now the stage selection dropdown in deployments list page is disabled when there is only one stage to display and stage names that are very big will not break the UX for the whole deployment journey. (RDEL-1703)</li>
<li>Improved the deployment experience. Now ODC seamlessly tries to recover from scenarios where a valid build does not exist for the selected app revision. In those situations, we will let you know that we are preparing your app and resume the deploy once it is ready. (RDEL-1836)</li>
<li>The new versioning feature for libraries enables an independent lifecycle for each library. If a new version is released, consumers can decide whether and when to adopt the update based on their needs and preferences. You can find more information on the <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/tk/redirect?g=5102d9d1-9716-46aa-9ab7-3c9640a7f79c">libraries documentation</a>. (RDLOT-2404)</li>
<li>With the new versioning feature for libraries, libraries will need to be versioned as a pre-requirement before submitting them to Forge. You can find out more on the <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/forge/submit_assets_to_forge/">Submit assets to Forge documentation</a>.
