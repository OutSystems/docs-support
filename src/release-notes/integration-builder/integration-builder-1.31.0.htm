<h3 id="new_in_integration_builder_1.31.0">New in Integration Builder 1.31.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now integrations with Salesforce, SharePoint, Microsoft Dataverse, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 include a new "Get<object name="">BasicOrderById" Server Action. This action enables the sorting of data and is available in the library module of these integrations. (RCNT-4098)</object></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_1.31.0">Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an "IntegrationBuilderUser role required" error message. This error message appeared after clicking an action button after your session expired. (RCNT-4444)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused a  "Missing value for mandatory input"  error message. This issue occurred when an Integration Builder dependency didn't have the version number in its description. (RCNT-4557)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused errors when generating Microsoft Dataverse or Dynamics 365 integrations during the publishing process.
Breaking change: For Dataverse/Dynamics 365 integrations, the static entities that listed all entity attributes will now only list readable attributes. (RCNT-4580)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented Integration Builder from installing/updating dependencies in some complicated circumstances. Integration Builder would not install needed components automatically when other components needed to be updated. (RCNT-4581)</li>
</ul>
