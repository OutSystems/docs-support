<ul>
<li>Added the TeamKey attribute to the Application's response structure used in the following endpoints: Applications_Get, Applications_List, Environments_GetRunningApp, Environments_GetRunningApps. By adding the TeamKey we're providing the unique identifier for the Team in the case an application is included in a team. (R11CT-4551)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the "Expose Entities" feature where the "Entity not public" label was incorrectly shown on the 'Propagate Views' screen. This happened when an entity view had been removed from the source environment but was still exposed in the target environment.
The label is now correctly displayed. (R11CT-4555) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the "Expose Entities" feature where removing an entity view could fail with a "Not Found" exception if the associated entity no longer existed.
The view is now properly removed from the local cache. (R11CT-4558) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the "Expose Entities" feature that caused the modules dropdown to appear empty on the 'ManageAccess' screen.
This occurred when the baseline environment was running a Platform Server version earlier than 11.38.0.
The list of available modules is now fetched correctly. (R11CT-4596) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the "Expose Entities" feature that caused the modules dropdown on the 'ManageAccess' screen to list extensions. External entities from extensions aren't supported by this feature.
The list of available modules is now fetched correctly by excluding extensions. (RPM-6449) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
</ul>
