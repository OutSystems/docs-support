<ul>
<li>Added a comment in the generated SQL of Advanced Queries and Aggregates with the location of the query in OutSystems applications. Configurable using Factory Configuration. Inspired by <a class="link-https" href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/4817/reverse-tracking-sql" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Neil Munro's idea</a>. (ABE-1151)</li>
<li>Improved the 1-Click Publish performance of modules containing references without entities or structures. (ABE-1275)</li>
<li>The automatic trigger URLs for the Deployment Zone of Container hosting technologies now send the module names (as a JSON array) of the application being deployed. (RSAT-1118)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_release_sep.2018_cp2">Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the incorrect serialization of input parameters of Date, Time and DateTime data types in consumed SOAP Web Services. This might have caused data corruption on some scenarios. Check the <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/11/Platform_Server#Known_Issues-21552" rel="internal">Known Issues</a> section in the Platform Server Release Sep.2018 Release Notes for more information. (RINT-3069)</li>
<li>We fixed an array compilation error in the SOAP web services that prevented module publishing. This affected only applications with the new SOAP implementation. (RPD-3627)</li>
<li>Fixed SAP connection testing in Service Center that always failed with an invalid login error. (RPD-3847)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that was causing the error "Duplicate is not a valid operation inside a StartIteration/EndIteration block" when using cached actions. (RPD-3698)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that was causing high memory consumption when using complex structures with several lists. (RPD-3633)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused JSON Deserialize to fail when deserializing Null DateTimes "1900-01-01T00:00:00" in Mobile Devices with Negative Timezones offsets. (RPD-3661)</li>
<li>Added module information to some Scheduler error logs where this information was missing. (RRCT-2072)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue deploying multiple module applications to containers when the publish order of the modules was interleaved, causing the deployment to containers to fail. (RSAT-1171)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Configuration Tool that was incorrectly checking log permissions when clicking the "Create/Upgrade Database" button for the platform database. (RSAT-1110)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented applications running in containers from picking up changes to the configuration files when configuration files are mounted in containers using SMB volumes or Kubernetes ConfigMaps. (RSAT-1117)</li>
<li>Changes in the license of an environment now correctly propagate to applications running in containers. (RSCT-1378)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented users from publishing a module after debugging it in a personal area. (RSCT-1656)</li>
