This minor release brings architecture improvements to unify the O11 and ODC mobile application build service. In order to support this change, some supported plugins were also updated. If you are building production apps with these specific plugins, we recommend you start upgrading the plugin versions for your apps to 11.2 immediately.

## MABS 11.1 { #mabs-version-11-1 }

<div class="info" markdown="1">

**First release:** 2025-03-28 14:30:00 UTC<br />
**Last update:** 2025-03-28 14:30:00 UTC.

Starting with MABS 11.1 the Upload Widget by default only allows selecting pictures or videos from the device's gallery. If you wish to capture pictures or videos from the device's camera, you need to add the [capture attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/capture) with the value **environment** to the Upload Widget in the IDE (see below) and then publish your app. This change only affects Android applications with the [AddUploadWidgetPermissions preference](./mabs-7.md#upload-widget-permissions) set to `true`.

### What's New

This minor version is focused on privacy and user experience improvements.

### Android

* Using the **Upload Widget** no longer requires the READ_MEDIA_IMAGES and READ_MEDIA_VIDEO permissions in order to comply with [Google Play's Photo and Video Permissions policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14115180?sjid=6224487226101929084-EU).
* **Upload Widget** now uses the [Android photo picker](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/04/photo-picker-everywhere.html), providing a faster user experience consistent across a range of devices with Android versions supported by MABS 11.

**Before MABS 11.1**

Upload Widget prompted the user for multiple permissions upfront to select a picture and didn't honor the limited access selection.

![Animation showing the old behavior of the Upload Widget prompting for multiple permissions.](images/demo-before-default.gif "Upload Widget old behavior")

**Staring with MABS 11.1**

Upload Widget no longer prompts for any permission for media selection and the apps can only access the user selection.

![Animation showing the new default behavior of the Upload Widget without prompting for permissions.](images/demo-after-default.gif "Upload Widget new default behavior")

Upload Widget only prompts for a single permission and immediately opens the Camera for media capture when the **capture** attribute is set.

### Breaking Changes and Known Limitations

Applies to MABS 11.1.

#### Upload Widget no longer offers the camera to capture media by default on Android

To let users take photos or videos directly with the Upload Widget on Android, set the [capture attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/capture) to **environment** and rebuild your app. OutSystems changed this to simplify things and make the widget behave like modern browsers expect. Check the release notes for more details.

This change affects applications built with MABS 11 and later. When targeting MABS versions earlier than 11, this attribute setting has no effect and can be safely ignored.

#### Upload Widget doesn't capture media on Android 9

The [capture attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/capture) doesn't work on Android 9 due to a system limitation. This means the Upload Widget cannot perform media capture regardless of the **capture** attribute.

Workarounds:

* Use the Camera app first to capture the picture or video, then switch to the app and select the captured media.
* Use the OutSystems Camera Plugin.
