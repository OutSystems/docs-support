<li>Fixed the inline records inside the widget input properties, to make the widgets work correctly and without runtime errors. (RTAFB-3604)</li>
<li>Fixed SetCurrentLocale Server Action so the locale changes correctly when you use this Action. We discovered this bug in the Multilingual technical preview feature for Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps. (RTAFB-3775)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause errors in PWAs (progressive web apps) running offline, if the PWAs were staged to a new environment in LifeTime or published from a solution. (RTAFB-3789)</li>

<h3>Breaking Change</h3>
<ul>
<li>Now, HTTP responses from Consumed REST API integrations are closed more aggressively. Previously, when doing numerous Consumed REST API requests, the number of used ports could increase rapidly and lead to port exhaustion problems. The new behaviour prevents this situation and helps avoid leaking resources, but can also cause runtime changes in some edge cases.<br/>
