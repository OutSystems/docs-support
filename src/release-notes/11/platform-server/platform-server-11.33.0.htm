<ul>
<li>Configuration Tool & Service Center's Test Connection will now issue a warning when connecting to unsupported SQLServer Databases. (R11BRT-1301)</li>

This occurred in the Monitoring tab, in Service Center. (R11BRT-1382)</li>

<li>Fixes an issue where BPTs stopped being launched, after a deployment to that environment failed, with an SQL exception timeout. (RPM-4582) <span class="cattag">Publish Operation</span>  <span class="cattag">Deployment stage</span> </li>

(RPM-5300) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">Platform Configuration</span> </li>
