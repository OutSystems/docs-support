<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where some consoles errors appeared for empty stylesheets (RPM-6443)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that allowed new timers to start while an instance was already active.
The issue was introduced after Jan 8th, 2026 and occurred in the second attempt to initiate a new Timer instance: the first concurrency check succeeded but the second failed, and a new Timer instance would be allowed.
Now, timer concurrency is correctly enforced, preventing duplicate instances. (RTAFB-8949)</li>
</ul>
