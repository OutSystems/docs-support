<h3>Breaking Change</h3>
<ul>
<li>The title of the Popup_Editor, Popup_EditorForUpload, and Popup_EditorVanilla is now encoded to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This may cause it to appear garbled in very specific scenarios.<br/>
Check <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Archive/11/OutSystems_Platform_side_effects_and_breaking_changes" rel="internal">OutSystems 11 side effects and breaking changes</a> for more details on the breaking change and a possible workaround. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>This Platform Server version suffers from an issue where factories with more than 1000 application permissions have their platform users (e.g. LifeTime, Service Center and Service Studio) losing permissions over the applications of an environment. This issue was introduced with Platform Server 11.14.0 and has been mitigated in Platform Server 11.16.0.</li>

This error occurred only while upgrading environments that were originally created with very early Platform Server versions, having the effective User Provider of the Users module set to the Enterprise Manager deprecated module.

This happens because IBM i Access for Windows has been replaced by IBM iAccess Client Solutions (ACS), therefore the required file "cwbdc.dll" is not installed anymore when following the previous installation checklist instructions. The checklist was updated to provide the correct instructions for integration with IBM Db2 databases.</p><p><a id="RPM-1522"><strong>RPM-1522</strong></a><br><b>Fixed the error "ORA-01489: result of string concatenation is too long" when publishing a module with an Action which description exceeds 4000 bytes.

This issue occurred when the description of an Action had less than 2000 characters, but more than 4000 bytes, which can happen, for example, for Japanese characters. In this scenario, publishing the module resulted in the error "ORA-01489: result of string concatenation is too long".</p><p><a id="RPM-1526"><strong>RPM-1526</strong></a><br><b>Fixed an issue that caused third-party components that used click events to not work as expected in PWA Mobile apps.</b><br><span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> <span class="cattag">Interface</span> <br><br><u>Fix Details:</u><br>The issue caused third-party components that used click events to not work as expected.

When changing database configuration is Configuration Tool and clicking ‘Apply and Exit’, this results in database or connection string errors. The error stack trace mentions get_NodeAwareSettingInConfigFilesFT() and PlatformSettings.isServiceConfigSetting.

*How to reproduce*
* Change the password of the OutSystems users. It should be enough to change the Administrator and Runtime user passwords.
* Open Configuration Tool, update the password fields with the newly defined passwords and click ‘Apply and Exit’
Configuration Tool should use the new credentials and run without errors, but instead an error similar to mentioned above will be returned.</p><p><a id="RPM-447"><strong>RPM-447</strong></a><br><b>Fixed multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Popup_Editor, Popup_EditorForUpload, or Popup_EditorVanilla titles.
