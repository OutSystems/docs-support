<ul>
<li>MySQL connector is generally available. (RDCIST-3182)</li>
<li>You can now enable external Identity Provider (IdP) authentication on ODC using custom identifiers such as employee IDs, phone numbers, social security, or VAT numbers, in addition to the traditional email and password login. This update gives you greater flexibility to tailor the authentication process to your industry's requirements or your organization's identity and access management strategy, while also delivering a smoother, more secure user experience.

When enabling username logins for your application, remember to republish all consumer apps after updating your login flow to ensure the changes take effect. (RDPP-2574)</li>
<li>Monthly Security Update (June 2025): Updated application container base image, including security fixes. Check Microsoft .NET 8.0.17/8.0.17 release for more details: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/8.0.17/8.0.17.md (RRCT-6464)</li>
