## Vulnerability summary

A security flaw was identified in Service Studio and Integration Studio for Windows only. If exploited, may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of:

* OutSystems Platform Server on version 10.
* Windows workstations of developers using Service Studio and Integration Studio 10 and 11.

OutSystems doesn't have any evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild or that any customer has been affected by it.

## Affected products

Only products listed at Vulnerable products and versions are known to be affected by this vulnerability. All other products aren’t affected by the aforementioned vulnerability.

### Vulnerable products and versions

This vulnerability affects:

* OutSystems Platform Server on versions 10 of .NET stack (due to the packaged version of Integration Studio).
* Windows workstations of developers using Service Studio and Integration Studio 10 or 11.

## Vulnerability details

Service Studio and Integration Studio weren't properly validating changes in the TLS connection. Secure connections were validated upon login but not on subsequent calls to the server. When these calls went through insecure channels the traffic could be eavesdropped or modified in transit.

## Workarounds

* **For OutSystems Platform Server on versions 10 and .NET stack**: ensure that the minimal [OutSystems network requirements](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/10/Setting_Up_OutSystems/OutSystems_network_requirements) are met.

* **For Windows workstations of developers using Service Studio and Integration Studio 10 and 11**: ensure that it only connects to trusted endpoints and the communication channels are safe.

## Fixed products and versions

OutSystems issued the following releases that address this vulnerability.

* Development Environment version 11.11.7

Given that the end of mainstream support for OutSystems Platform 10 happened on May 31st, 2020, and there was an [extended support phase for OutSystems 10](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/OutSystems_Support/End_of_Mainstream_Support_for_OutSystems_Platform_10#:~:text=The%20end%20of%20mainstream%20support,and%20last%20until%20August%2031), no Platform Server on version 10 will be issued. This vulnerability doesn't affect current versions of the Platform Server, and that's why we encourage you to upgrade your infrastructure to Platform Server 11. By doing so, you’ll benefit from the enhanced capabilities of our most recent releases, as well as full continued support and maintenance.
