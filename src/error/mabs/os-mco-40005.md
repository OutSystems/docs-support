# OS-MCO-40005

## Error message

`Extensibility Configurations of <AssetName> include plugin sources, but none of them are compatible with <MobileFramework>.`

## Cause

Plugins can specify separate sources for different mobile frameworks, including Capacitor and Cordova. While Capacitor-based mobile builds can include sources from both frameworks, Cordova-based builds can only include Cordova sources.

## Impact

The mobile compilation fails, causing the native mobile build to fail.

## Recommended action

Start using Capacitor as the mobile framework for your mobile app.

If that's not possible because your app or some plugins aren't ready for Capacitor, you can remove the plugins that only provide Capacitor sources from your mobile app. Alternatively, you can provide a suitable Cordova source for the plugins that only provide Capacitor sources. Here's an example of extensibility configurations with both Capacitor and Cordova sources for a plugin:

```json
{
  "buildConfigurations": {
    "capacitor": {
      "source": {
        "npm": "@capacitor/camera@1.2.3"
      }
    },
    "cordova": {
      "source": {
        "npm": "cordova-plugin-camera@7.8.9"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
