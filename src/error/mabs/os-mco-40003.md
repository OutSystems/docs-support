# OS-MCO-40003

## Error message

`Extensibility Configurations are missing a usage description for iOS permission <Permission>.`

## Cause

Libraries can declare iOS permissions in their extensibility configurations. These permissions require a usage description, but it doesn’t have to be defined within the library itself. Instead, the mobile app that uses the library should provide the usage description for the permission.

## Impact

The mobile compilation fails, causing the native mobile build to fail.

## Recommended action

Add the missing usage description for the iOS permission in your mobile app's extensibility configurations. Here's an example of how to provide a usage description for the `NSCameraUsageDescription` permission:

```json
{
  "appConfigurations": {
    "permissions": {
      "ios": {
        "NSCameraUsageDescription": "This app requires camera access to take photos."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can remove the permission declaration from the library if it's not needed. However, if you're unsure whether the permission is required, don't remove it.

You can also remove the library that declares the iOS permission from your mobile app.
