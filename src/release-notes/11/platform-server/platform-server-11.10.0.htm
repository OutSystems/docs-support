<h2>Platform Server 11.10.0</h2>
<h3>New in Platform Server 11.10.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>The error logs about the server responses in Mobile/Reactive apps now have information about the endpoint in use. (RAR-259)</li>
<li>You can now try out the Reactive and Mobile applications using the React 16 version. Start by enabling this technical preview feature in LifeTime. (RAR-270)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that was blocking the user to set big extensibility configurations on LifeTime.
It depends on LifeTime version 11.6.1. (RLIT-3938)</li>
<li>Added support for email SMTP servers using implicit SSL connections on port 465. (RPD-4025)</li>
<li>It is now possible to apply settings to the OutSystems factory using a command-line flag of Configuration Tool. (RPD-4862)</li>
<li>Added a retry mechanism for database deadlocks that occur while obtaining user information from the database. (RPST-374)</li>
<li>Now, when the Purpose of an environment changes a log entry is added. (RPST-883)</li>
<li>Added support for PLAIN authentication when connecting to email SMTP servers. OutSystems uses PLAIN authentication when LOGIN authentication is not available. (RRCT-2935)</li>
<li>Upgraded NLog libraries to version 4.7.2. (RRCT-2965)</li>
<li>Improved the third-party libraries version algorithm added in the previous Platform Server versions to be more resilient regarding extensions that were created incorrectly. (RRCT-3102)</li>
<li>Platform Server installation logs are now placed on the %localappdata%\OutSystems\PlatformInstaller folder. (RSAT-2289)</li>
<li>You can now optimize the amount of data transferred from the server side to the client side of Mobile and Reactive Web Apps. The optimization works for Screen Aggregates, Data Actions, and for the Server Actions in the logic flows of Screen Client Actions. This is a technical preview feature and you need to activate the option "Client-side optimizations for Reactive Web Apps" or "Client-side optimizations for Mobile Apps". (RTAFB-3260)</li>
<li>You can now translate the UI of your Reactive Web Apps and Mobile Apps directly inside Service Studio. Multilingual is a technical preview feature and you need to activate the option "Multilingual for Mobile and Reactive" in LifeTime. After enabling the feature, use the new Multilingual Locales folder and new SetCurrentLocale system client action. (RTAFB-3388)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the app upgrade mechanism when technical preview "Configure Mobile application updates distribution" is on. Previously, a native mobile app would still use the hybrid updates on the first load. (RAR-219)</li>
<li>Improved the error message when the app requires local storage access and IndexedDB isn't supported. (RAR-220)</li>
<li>Fixed authenticated user losing the roles while navigating from a Traditional to a Reactive app, with Single Sign-On activated. (RAR-307)</li>
<li>Fixed the CSS for the Dropdown widget. Now the CSS rules apply correctly. (RAR-332)</li>
<li>Fixed the scroll behavior of the Dropdown widget with Options Content set to Custom, in Reactive/Mobile apps. Previously the content scrolled down when users selected an item. (RAR-341)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused Service Center to incorrectly count Internal and External Users from disabled User Providers as active users. (RIDT-95)</li>
<li>Action User_CreateOrUpdate of Users API now prevents the creation of new users with an existing username. (RLIT-3711)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that was setting the wrong application description when creating the application through LifeTime. (RLIT-3888)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Service Center that was causing a weird behavior on the application edit screen when the setting .NET Globalization/UI Culture in IIS was set to pt-BR. (RLIT-3895)</li>
<li>We made several improvements in Service Center's Request Log screen (still in beta version): fixed an exception thrown when opening the Request Log screen through the Request Key link on the Error Log screen in Oracle databases; fixed an issue that caused the Timer details link to always redirect to the wrong screen; now the Request Logs screen works better for large factories. (RLIT-3904)</li>
<li>Fixed error "[OSNOP5].DBO.[OSSYS_CLOUDPROVIDERTYPE] with key 0 was not found" in Service Center. (RLIT-3982)</li>
<li>Fixed Expressions linked to the show-default-value attribute in Input widgets to reevaluate correctly after change. (RPD-4850)</li>
<li>Now you can choose the NameId format from a list of options when configuring SAML 2.0 Authentication for end users in the Users application. (RPD-5000)</li>
<li>Fixed compilation error that occurred when there was a new attribute in a producer structure with a default value that wasn't refreshed in a consumer. (RPD-5039)</li>
<li>Changed IIS configurations to define the minWorkerThreads. This change will not be applied if this value is already configured. (RPD-5040)</li>

<li>Fixed broken image links to images in Mobile Apps and Reactive Web Apps when using a referenced action from another module to get the image. (RPD-5111)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Popup_Editor block from RichWidgets was largely increasing the ViewState size by deprecating it into the Deprecated_Popup_Editor block and splitting it into two new blocks: The Popup_EditorForUpload to be used for the Popup_Upload screen, which requires some data on the ViewState; and the Popup_Editor to be used with any other screen, which does not require data on the ViewState. (RPD-5221)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that occurred while using Oracle as the platform database that recreated indexes of entities on every publish of the module. (RPM-310)</li>
<li>Fixed SSO between different app types so the roles are correctly updated and users are no longer blocked from accessing the screens in the session. (RPM-312)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the static entities that shared the same first 10 characters to have the same translation table. This only affects Platform's that use Oracle database. (RPM-313)</li>
<li>Fixed compilation error that occurred when there was a new attribute in a producer structure with a default value that wasn't refreshed in a consumer. (RPD-5039) (RPM-316)</li>

The fix consists of changing the 20 minutes timeout on the entire System Component installation, to 5 minutes timeout on each module. (RPM-500)</li>
<li>Fixed database error in Oracle when publishing a module whose extended configurations exceed 4000 chars. (RPM-539)</li>
<li>Improved the error message shown when a module is not found while publishing a solution. Now the message states "Module <module-name> with version <version-number> not found" instead of "The given key was not present in the dictionary". (RPST-363)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in re-deploy operations that, in some situations, reused the folder of the currently running application. (RPST-371)</li>
<li>Fixed database error in oracle when publishing a module whose extended configurations exceed 4000 characters. (RPST-926)</li>
<li>Fixed issue in extension compilation during upgrades when the extension used deprecated internal methods. (RRCT-2956)</li>

<li>We added support for logging request events of server-side executions in Mobile and Reactive Web Apps. The logging of these request events is disabled by default. (RRCT-2985)</li>
<li>Timestamps used for session fixation protection are now stored using the UTC time zone. This prevents checks from being too aggressive during Daylight Saving Time transitions. (RRCT-3051)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where applications became unavailable while publishing solutions due to License Validations. (RRCT-3215)</li>
<li>Updated the MySQL driver to version 8.0.20 and updated its dependencies. (RSAT-1965)</li>
<li>Improvement on performance for session model in Oracle. To take advantage of this improvement, you will need to upgrade the Session Database in Configuration Tool. (RSAT-1977)</li>

<li>Fixed an issue that caused System Components installation via Configuration Tool to timeout when the Platform Server is under heavy use. (RSUPT-292)</li>
<li>Fixed "Cannot read property 'setAttribute' of undefined" error when creating nested tables with Table Records widget in Reactive Web App. (RTAFB-2995)</li>
<li>We fixed the issues in SSO between app types causing "invalidating espace caches" error messages in Service Center, by improving the lifecycle of cookies involved in SSO between app types. (RTAFB-3153)</li>
