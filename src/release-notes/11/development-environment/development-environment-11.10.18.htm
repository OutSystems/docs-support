<b>Issue</b>: After updating to this version, opening an older version of Service Studio 11 in the same machine resets local Service Studio settings. These settings include the Service Studio preferences, the list of environments and recently opened modules, and login information.<br/>
<b>Rationale</b>: We changed the syntax of the local settings file (C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\OutSystems\ServiceStudio 11.0\Settings.xml) to support upcoming features.<br/>
<b>Workaround</b>: Before opening this version of Service Studio 11, please backup the settings files located in (C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\OutSystems\ServiceStudio 11.0\Settings.xml).
</li>
