<h3 id="known_issues_11.10.1">Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>In farm environments, if there is a symbolic link to the Platform Server folder, it's possible for the Configuration Tool to be executed from different locations. e.g “F:\Program Files\OutSystems\Platform Server” is the platform installation folder and “C:\Program Files\OutSystems\” is a symbolic link. Every time Configuration Tool is run from a different location, it will corrupt some platform settings and it will cause DLLs to be wrongly deleted from the front-end.<br/>
