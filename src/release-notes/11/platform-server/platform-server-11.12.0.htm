<h2>Platform Server 11.12.0</h2>
<div class="info"><p>Released on May 24, 2021</p></div>

<h3>New in Platform Server 11.12.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can now Expose REST webservices using the PATCH verb. This capability is a technical preview feature and you need to activate the option "PATCH method in exposed REST APIs" in LifeTime. (R11DT-89)</li>
<li>It is no longer possible to concurrently publish the same modules in Solutions and individually. Modules in Solutions remain locked for the duration of the Solution publish. (R11PIT-176)</li>
<li>Upgraded to React 16. The platform runtime in Platform Server 11.12.0 and later uses the upgraded version of React, React 16. Although we’ve been testing this with help of multiple customers in multiple scenarios, we know that on rare occasions this upgrade may break some JavaScript extensibility code not compliant with React 16 so we recommend you fully test your Web Reactive and Mobile applications after the upgrade. This upgrade may also break the following components, so make sure you update to the latest versions from Forge: Multilingual Component, Input Masks Library, Input Masks Mobile. (RAR-174)</li>
<li>We improved the accessibility of the Table. The Table widget now has the following ARIA attributes: role="grid" and aria-rowcount. The cells in the Table have aria-colindex and aria-rowindex, while the header cell has aria-sort. (RAR-316)</li>
<li>We improved the Button Group widget accessibility by adding the following ARIA attributes: role="radiogroup", aria-activedescendant, role="radio", and aria-checked (if required by the item state). (RAR-319)</li>
<li>Improved the performance of Aggregates in PWAs when you use Join Conditions or Filters with more than one comparison. (RAR-381)</li>
<li>We improved the Radio Group widget accessibility by adding the following ARIA attributes: role="radiogroup", aria-activedescendant, role="radio", and aria-checked (if required by the item state). (RAR-433)</li>
<li>Native build now uses timeout returned by MABS instead of predefined value. (RLIT-4329)</li>
<li>With OutSystems Now being deprecated, the WebScreenClientExecuted event from PerformanceMonitoring API no longer retrieves properties related to applications running on mobile devices (DMan, Dmod, Dplat, DPlatV, NT, CN, CCC, CNT). (RLIT-4405)</li>
<li>When distributing an Android application using MABS 7, it is now possible to choose an Android App Bundle build type to generate an .aab file to upload to the Play store. (RNMT-4579) (RNMT-4579)</li>
<li>Redesigned the download page for mobile applications generated by MABS. (RNMT-4615)</li>

<li>Upgrading to the Oracle Managed Driver (19.10.1), fixes the ORA-12514 error in the Oracle Rac (Real Application Cluster). For more information on this and other fixes, see the Oracle release notes.  (RPLAT-542)</li>
<li>Now, with Flexible Upgrades, after upgrading the Platform Server, you can opt to publish your applications gradually, following your teams' pace, instead of being required to publish all your applications directly after the upgrade. Not yet available in Platform installations running over Oracle, only for SQL Server. (RSUPT-705)</li>
<li>Now you can configure friendly URLs in your Reactive Web Apps. Go to  Service Center > Administration > SEO URLs to set up the site rules and redirects. Configure the page rules in Service Studio, by setting Custom URLs to Yes in the Screen properties. SEO Friendly URLs is a technical preview feature, and you need to activate the option "SEO Friendly URLs" in LifeTime.  (RTAFB-3869)</li>
<li>Inside Service Studio, you can now translate the UI for Reactive Web and Mobile Apps. (RTAFB-4112)</li>
<li>Added the server-to-client data transfer optimization for the Mobile and Reactive Web Apps. The optimization works for Screen Aggregates, Data Actions, and for the Server Actions in the logic flows of Screen Client Actions. (RTAFB-4331)</li>
<li>Now you can, in Mobile and Reactive Web Apps, create lightweight emails with basic navigation and styling. Emails in Reactive and Mobile is a technical preview feature, so you need to activate the option "Emails for Mobile and Reactive" in LifeTime. (RTAFB-4361)</li>
