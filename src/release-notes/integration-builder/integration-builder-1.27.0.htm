<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused errors when generating a Salesforce integration that includes objects with labels longer than 50 characters. In Service Studio, refresh the dependencies of apps that consume Salesforce integrations that include objects with labels longer than 50 characters.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused runtime errors when there are spaces in an SAP OData service URL.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused errors in connections to external databases after editing the connection name.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused timeouts when generating a Salesforce integration and when there are too many selected pick-list fields.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the Setup popup to show again after you closed it.</li>
<li>Improvement in the publishing integrations experience. Now, developers can see how long the publishing of integration will take and also check the progress of the publishing.</li>
<li>Integrations that were changed after being published now have an icon marking them as having pending changes.</li>
<li>Improvement in the "Choose a provider" screen. In small resolution screens, it was not clear for the developer that there were more providers available when the developer scrolls down.</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of the Review button on the "Review" screen for the external database providers. The button now opens a modal to list selected entities, instead of navigating to the "Add entities" screen.</li>
<li>Improvement on the "Add entities" screen to keep consistency on the entities table across all providers.</li>
</ul>
