# OS-MABS-GEN-40017

## Error message

`There was an issue generating the app. Gradle now requires you to declare dependencies using “implementation” or “api” instead of “compile”. The dependency being incorrectly declared is “{0}”. Check your plugin configurations and try again.`

## Cause

This error occurs when you are generating an Android package with MABS 8 or higher because Gradle 7 or higher doesn't support `compile` as a way to declare dependencies.

## Impact

The Android application package can't be generated.

## Recommended action

Check the build logs on Service Center to identify the affected custom plugin and replace `compile` dependencies in Gradle files with `implementation` or `api`.
