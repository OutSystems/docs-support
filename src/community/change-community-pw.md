* After you reset your password, allow for 3 minutes before trying to sign in again to your Personal Environment. This is necessary for the password from community profile to sync with your Personal Environment.

* After a certain number of wrong attempts to sign in, your account may be blocked for the duration of one hour. The 1 hour lock remains even after you reset your password.
