<ul>
<li>[Mentor AppGen]
<ul>
<li>Expanded Enterprise Integration Capabilities - Mentor-generated apps can now write data directly to public entities from any application of the tenant, making it easier to build connected, enterprise-ready solutions.
<ul>
      <li>Guidelines:</li>
      <ul>
      <li>Write operation for public entities will be available only when the entity has the createOrUpdate action available</li>
      <li>Delete records from public entities will be available only when the entity has the delete action available</li>
      </ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New screen template available: Mentor now suggests a lightweight Pop-up screen template instead of generating the standard List, Edit, and Detail screens when an entity has a low number of attributes and no relationships. This enhancement enables faster and more focused interactions, making it ideal for simple entities that require quick edits.</li>
<li>AI-Powered UI Personalization
<ul>
<li>Mentor now automatically suggests a Font Awesome icon and header color for your app, enhancing the design experience with smarter defaults and expanding the theme properties driven by AI.</li>
<li>Mentor now respects the userâ€™s intent, on both prompt and requirements document, regarding the need to include a dashboard on the App.</li>
</ul>
</li>
