<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the platform's messaging system could become out-of-sync, causing Events and Workflows not to be executed.
This occurred when message filtering rules were dynamically updated, preventing some platform services from correctly processing messages.
Affected scenarios:
- Event handlers not triggered despite successful event publication
- Workflow execution not triggered (RPM-6095)</li>
</ul>
