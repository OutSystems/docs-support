# OutSystems exams scheduling, cancelation and refund policies

The OutSystems certification program was built to foster an ecosystem of skilled professionals who deliver high-end quality solutions. Outsystems certification program includes a set of certification and specialization exams. Certification exams are designed to certify individuals and teams as OutSystems professionals for different proficiency levels and roles. Specializations are shorter exams focused on specific topics or areas, resulting in the final outcome for a role or experience level or as a path to attain a new certification.

Before taking an exam, we recommend you read the [How to prepare for the exam](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJHR8-J0urVq1RvMJLjzNEBvBbrxg035/view) guide.

In the following sections, you can find answers to the most frequently asked questions about OutSystems exam scheduling, canceling, and refund policies.

## Certification exam FAQs

### Registration

#### I registered for the exam, but I didn't receive the confirmation appointment email. What should I do?

Start by checking your Spam folder, as it may be there. If you still cannot find the confirmation appointment email 24 hours after you registered for your exam, open a support case for Training detailing your name, email, and exam you registered to. The team will give you all the necessary information.
 
#### How can I pay for my exam?

Exams can only be paid for using a credit card. For candidates who don't have one, OutSystems recommends creating one via MBway/MBnet (for Portugal-based candidates) or any other virtual platform that allows you to create credit cards.

#### What are the ID documents I can present on the day of the exam?

On the day of the exam, you must bring a physical government national ID card with your name and photo.

**Note**: Digital documents are not allowed.

Acceptable forms of ID include:​​​​
* State or government-issued ID
* Passport book/card
* National ID card
* Alien registration card
* Chinese national ID
* Driver's license
* Aadhar card (India)
* PAN Card (India)
* Any other government-issued national/state/province identity document recognized by the country in which the test taker is a citizen or resident and is taking their exam. These include IDs in non-Latin characters such as Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, and Urdu, among others, as long as they can be validated by the proctor.

    For exams in test centers, your ID card must be recognized or issued by the country you are taking the exam. If that is not the case, you must present any of the acceptable forms of ID with your name, photograph, and date of birth in Latin characters.
 
#### I registered for an exam, but my name doesn't match my ID document. What should I do?

The name in the confirmation email should be exactly the same as the one on the test-taker's ID card. Outsystem's proctors use this validation to assess a secure environment and confirm that you are the actual person who is scheduled to take the exam.

If you have already scheduled your exam, you cannot change the name on the appointment. You must cancel the exam, update your [OutSystems Community](https://www.outsystems.com/community/) profile name, and then register again for the exam using the correct name. 
Before the exam, make sure to update your [OutSystems Community](https://www.outsystems.com/community/) profile information with the same name that appears on your ID document.

You can find out more about the rescheduling and cancellation policies in OutSystems [Terms and Conditions](https://www.outsystems.com/cms_backoffice/assets/20170327162431/terms_and_conditions_outsystems).
 
#### The button to launch my exam on ProProctor is disabled. What should I do?

If the button to launch your exam is disabled, this is because you're trying to access it too early. You can only access your exam 15 to 30 minutes before the scheduled time on the scheduled date.​​​​​​​
 
#### I can't register for an exam because the page shows a Reschedule button instead of a Schedule button. What should I do?

If the **Reschedule** button is displayed instead of the **Schedule** button, it's because you've already scheduled the exam you're trying to register for. Search for an email with the subject **Appointment Confirmation Email** in your mailbox. The email contains the scheduled date and time for your exam.

If you are sure you haven't already scheduled the exam or cannot find the appointment, [​​​​​​​open a support case for Training](https://www.outsystems.com/SupportPortal/CaseOpen/) detailing the issue.
  
#### If I choose to take a remote exam in a language other than English, will the experience and online support be available in the selected language?

No, the language choice refers exclusively to the exam's content when it comes to exams offered in languages other than English. The experience, proctor support, and online support are only available in English. Therefore, it is still relevant that you have an intermediate level of proficiency to communicate with the proctor during the exam setup or if you need assistance.

### Vouchers 

#### I received a voucher, but I get an error message when I try to use it. What should I do?

If you're getting an error message, it can be for one of the following reasons:
* The voucher is expired
* You are selecting a date after the voucher's validity date
* You might be using the voucher for the wrong exam.
* You might be leaving spaces or characters when using the voucher, so make sure to delete them.

If you have already validated all these points, ​​​​​​[​​​​​​​open a support case for Training](https://www.outsystems.com/SupportPortal/CaseOpen/) detailing this issue. The team will verify and solve it for you.​​​​​
  
#### When in the registration process should I use the voucher code?

The voucher code field appears on the last screen of the registration process.​​​​
 
#### I have a voucher. When can I schedule my exam using this voucher?

You must schedule and take your exam before the voucher expiration. For example, if your voucher expires on December 31, 2023, you must register, schedule, and take the exam before this date. Ensure you schedule your exam in advance (at least 2 weeks before the expiration date).

**Note:** It is not possible to schedule your exam for a date after the voucher expiration date.
 
### Scheduling

#### How do I schedule my exam?

To schedule an exam, follow these steps:
1. Confirm the exam you selected during registration
1. Choose the timezone you intend to take your exam
1. Select a start and end date period (maximum 15 days) to check the available slots
1. Choose a date and time that suits you 

#### What do I need to bring to the exam (onsite or online)?

Ensure you have your personal ID with you. You are required to show one valid, government-issued photo ID with a signature (for example, a driver’s license, national ID, or a valid passport). The name on your ID must match your registration. 

#### What time do I need to arrive at the exam (onsite or online)?

If you're taking the exam at a Prometric test center, plan to arrive 30 minutes before the scheduled appointment. This allows you enough time to complete the check-in procedures. If you arrive late, you will not be allowed to take your exam, and you'll lose your exam fee.

#### I'm trying to schedule my exam, but I'm not sure if the slots are in the morning or afternoon. How can I find out?

Depending on your browser's setup, the scheduling system displays time in a 24-hour or 12-hour format.

#### There are no slots available to schedule the exam. What can I do?

When scheduling the exam, be sure to select the recommended 2-week time frame so you get the maximum number of slots available. You can change the selected start date and choose the best time frame for you.
 
#### I want to reschedule my exam. What is the rescheduling policy?

The rescheduling policy depends on when you reschedule your exam:
* Up to 15 days before the exam's original scheduled date and time - you can reschedule your exam for free.
* Between 14 days ahead of its date and up to 48 hours ahead - you can reschedule your exam by paying an extra fee.
* Less than 48 hours before the date and time scheduled or after the date of the original appointment has passed - you cannot reschedule your exam.​​​​​​​​​​​​​
 
#### I want to cancel my exam. When can I do it and ensure I get a refund?

To get a refund when canceling the exam, you must cancel it up to 15 days before the exam's original scheduled date and time. Otherwise, you will not get a refund.

**Note**: Exams cannot be canceled less than 48 hours before or after the original appointment date.
 
#### I can't reschedule my exam because I'm getting this error message: ``Error - We were unable to book your appointment. Please return later to start your appointment selection again. `` What should I do?

You're getting this message because you're trying to reschedule the exam less than 48 hours before the scheduled exam date.

You can only reschedule an exam up to 48 hours before the exam's scheduled date and time. For more information about our rescheduling and cancellation policies, refer to the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.outsystems.com/cms_backoffice/assets/20170327162431/terms_and_conditions_outsystems).

#### For rescheduling or canceling reasons, I'm asked for 4 characters of my last name. My last name only has 3 letters. Can I still reschedule or cancel my exam?

Yes. By default, all candidates have a user created with their last name using four letters. But if your name only has two or three letters, you can use them.​​​​​​​
 
#### What is the confirmation number, and how do I access it?

The confirmation number is a 16-digit numeric identifier for your scheduled exam session. Once you finish scheduling your exam, you should receive the email with the subject **Appointment Confirmation Email**, which includes this information.

If you can’t find it, check your Spam folder. If you still can't find it, ​​​​​​[​​​​​​​open a support case for Training](https://www.outsystems.com/SupportPortal/CaseOpen/) and request that the confirmation email be resent. Share your name, email, and the exam you have registered for. The team will give you all the details.
 
#### How can I change my exam appointment from a remote test to a test center and vice versa?

To change your exam appointment to a remote/test center, you must visit the [Reschedule Appointment](https://proscheduler.prometric.com/scheduling/rescheduleappointment/reschedule) page, cancel the appointment, and register again on the [Certification Page](https://www.outsystems.com/certifications/), select the **Online/Certification Center** option.​​​​​

Keep in mind that you can cancel your exam up to 48 hours before the original scheduled date and time. If you try to cancel it within less than 48 hours before the exam date and time, you will lose your exam slot.​​​​​​
 
#### I have already scheduled my exam, but I don't know if the time is AM or PM. How can I confirm?

The scheduled time is in your Confirmation Email. Please note that the appointments are shown in 24-hour format (for example, 02:00 is 2 AM and 14:00 is 2 PM).
