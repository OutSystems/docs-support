## Error message

`There was an issue generating the app. Some plugins using CocoaPods aren’t correctly configured or a pod wasn’t found in the repository. Check your plugin configurations and try again.`

## Cause

Generating the iOS application package failed because Cocoapods aren't configured correctly or a pod can’t be found in the repository.

## Impact

The iOS application package can't be generated.

## Recommended action

Check the build logs on Service Center to confirm which pod is affected and identify which custom plugin is introducing it. Then, check the plugin Cocoapods configuration.
