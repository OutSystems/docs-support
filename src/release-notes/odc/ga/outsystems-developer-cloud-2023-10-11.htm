<h3 id="new_in_outsystems_developer_cloud_2023-10-11" > New</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a validation to the 'Run now' option in Timers that won't allow triggering more than one execution of a timer at the same time. (RDLOT-1695)</li>
<li>Now, the producers list on the app detail screen is sorted by name. (RDLOT-2166)</li>
<li>From now on, a new version of ODC Studio is available for MacOS users that have devices with M-series processors. We expect this version to improve the ODC Studio’s overall performance on these devices. Each MacOS user should download the right version, according to their devices' processors (Intel or M-series). (RDLOT-2273)</li>
<li>Improved the ODC Portal experience when configuring a timer's schedule, by allowing users to select more effectively the options for calendar-based schedules (monthly, weekly, and daily). (RDLOT-2302)</li>
<li>Updated the user's contextual menu on ODC Portal accessible in the top right corner to include the user's picture, name and email. (RDPP-1163)</li>
<li>Improved the behavior when filtering for end-user groups and end-user roles. Now, when filtering for a specific app, there exists a specific filter applied to end-user groups, and a specific filter applied to end-user roles that can be used separately. (RDPP-1185)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue related to permissions when creating mobile packages. Now, with the “Deploy apps” permission, even if the user doesn’t have the “Edit configurations“ permission, it will be possible to create new mobile packages, using the values already configured for previous packages. (RDLOT-2110)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the create mobile package page, that was not selecting automatically the MABS version used on the previously created package. (RDLOT-2242)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the app detail screen that was presenting an empty tab placeholder for users who lack permission to access the configurations tab. (RDLOT-2291)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some App Templates were not presenting the list of producers, on the app detail screen. (RDLOT-2319)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on ODC Portal that was presenting an empty dropdown for some App Templates on the app detail screen. (RDLOT-2321)</li>
</ul>
