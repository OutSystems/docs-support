<h3 id="new_in_mabs_2023-10-26" > New</h3>
<ul>

<li>Update Native Shell to target the latest Android 14 SDK. (RNMT-6192)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_mabs_2023-10-26" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the build to fail in some edge cases, when using the <a href=”[https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/config_ref/|https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/config_ref/]”>cordova preferences</a> <i>android-minSdkVersion</i> and <i>deployment-target</i>. (RNMT-6290)</li>
</ul>

<h3> Breaking Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The legacy Android Support Libraries (<i>com.android.support</i>) are no longer supported. Builds containing these libraries will fail until they are migrated to their <a href=”https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate/artifact-mappings”>respective AndroidX counterpart</a>. Owners of non-supported plugins using Android Support Libraries must migrate their plugins to work with MABS 10. (RNMT-6187)</li>
<li>Removed functionality that was specifically adding <i>aps-environments</i> to plist when present in the provisioning profile. This should be handled by each plugin making use of the <i>aps-environment</i> entitlement, and not generically by MABS since not all applications need this. (RNMT-5935)</li>
</ul>
