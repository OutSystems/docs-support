<h4 id="highlights_release_1">Highlights</h4>
<ul>
<li>Developers are able to create new screens based on templates that were previously made available in the factory. (RAFT-1023)</li>
<li>Now you can quickly replace a UI data source by dragging other entity to the corresponding widget, such as a List or a Form. (RAFT-1388)</li>
<li>You can now disable part of the logic flow. Select some elements of the flow, right-click and choose "Disable Elements". Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/57/"><u>Joost's idea</u></a>. (RIUT-7)</li>
<li>Now it's possible to organize the application elements such as Entities, Structures, Images, and Resources into folders. Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/784/"><u>Robert's idea</u></a>. (RIUT-319)</li>
<li>You can now move Actions to a different folder without breaking the consumer references. Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/1393/"><u>Justin James' idea</u></a>. (RICT-800)</li>
<li>You can now use inline values as inputs for the structured types. This enables you to conveniently provide, for example, sample values to charts. Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/2738/"><u>Hans Dollen's idea</u></a>. (RICT-821)</li>
<li>After publishing your module, you can now quickly open the outdated consumer modules by right-clicking the warning. Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/250/"><u>Robert's idea</u></a>.</li>

<h4 id="architecture_release_1">Architecture</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added a new application and module type (Services) to promote a better application segmentation and governance. (ABE-1276)</li>
<li>Added a new language element (Service Action) which is a loosely coupled action (REST underneath) with impact analysis and security by default. (ABE-1277)</li>
<li>Optional parameters and attributes do not require refreshing consumers, making larger systems more loosely coupled and allowing independent teams to release more often without impacting each other. (ABE-1278)</li>
<li>Public Screens are now loosely coupled that results in no circular references in dependency analysis. (ABE-1279)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="interface_release_1">Interface</h4>

<li>UI blocks can now have sample content in their placeholders to accelerate the development and make them easier to use. (RAFT-1069)</li>
<li>New method registerDeviceClassGetter added to JS Public API allows to change the default behavior of adapting the css classes applied to the device resolution. By default, resolution higher than 1024px are considered tablets. (RAFT-1296)</li>
<li>Styles Editor now supports grid units (e.g. "2 col") and you can use it without a local theme. Also, the widget styles are now generated as the inline CSS, which gives you more freedom when editing a module. (RICT-663)</li>
<li>We upgraded the internal browser of Service Studio. This improves the WYSIWYG editor and enables you to have a more accurate preview of screens and blocks. (RICT-35)</li>
</ul>
