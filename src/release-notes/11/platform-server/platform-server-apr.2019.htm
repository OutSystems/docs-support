<h2 id="platform_server_release_apr.2019">Platform Server Release Apr.2019</h2>
<div class="info"><p>Released on May 06, 2019</p></div>
<h3 id="new_in_platform_server_release_apr.2019">New in Platform Server Release Apr.2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clicking Environment/Module Management in the toolbar now opens Service Center in the default browser instead of render it directly inside Service Studio. (RICT-825)</li>
<li>We changed the SQL Injection warning message to advise you not to set the use of Expand Inline option to "Yes". The warning helps to follow solid SQL security practices. (RRCT-2128)</li>
<li>Improved the experience of the Users application. We gave it a new look and feel and made the following usability improvements:<br/>
— Page-specific links/actions were moved to inside the pages; the sidebar will now only display fixed links and recent items<br/>
— Added breadcrumbs to pages and pagination and records counter to all pages showing lists<br/>
— Added text filter in users sub-lists<br/>
— When a user does not have a username defined it appears as "Not Defined" in the lists so that you can click it<br/>
— Roles, Groups and Users dropdowns don't show the records already added to the lists; however, roles still show when they were inherited by group to allow overriding<br/>
— When a role is inherited by a group, it does not show the option to remove the role, since this operation is not possible<br/>
— Added the list of users able to access the application to the Application_List page – inspired by <a class="link-https" href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/4962/Users+Application+Bugs%2fImprovements" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Rebecca Hall's idea</a> (RLIT-2343)</li>
<li>Added a new action Session_GetWebAppLoginInfo to the PlatformRuntime API that allows you to get user information in advanced REST authentication scenarios. (RRCT-2274)</li>
<li>The VerifySqlLiteral action from Sanitization API was deprecated in favor of BuildSafe_InClauseIntegerList and BuildSafe_InClauseTextList. These new actions are available in Platform Server 10.0.1005.0 and in Platform Server 11.0.422.0. (RRCT-2108)</li>
<li>Added instructions on importing the server configuration file (exported from the Deployment Controller) in the Front-end servers when upgrading to a new release. Inspired by <a class="link-https" href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/6327/v11-installation-checklist-improvement" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kurt Vandevelde's idea</a>. (RSAT-1314)</li>
<li>The Platform Installer will now automate most of the prerequisites and performance tuning setup. The GUI has screens that guide you through this new step. Also, a new flag (/InstallPrerequisites=True) was added to unattended installation that is needed to signal explicitly that the installer should try to automate the prerequisites and performance tuning setup. (RSAT-1308)</li>
<li>Platform Server now requires Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.7.2. We recommend that you check both the "Runtime Changes" and "Retargeting Changes" pages in the <a class="link-https" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/runtime/4.6.1-4.7.2" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/runtime/4.6.1-4.7.2">Microsoft .NET Framework documentation</a> to identify any possible impacts that this update might have on your OutSystems applications. Installing this version will require you to reboot your server. (RSAT-1396)</li>
<li>The base image required for OutSystems applications running on Docker Containers Deployment Technology is now "microsoft/dotnet-framework:4.7.2-runtime". (RSAT-1397)</li>
<li>Upgraded RabbitMQ Client library to version 5.1.0. (RRCT-2142)</li>
<li>Upgraded Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi libraries to version 5.2.7. (RRCT-2143)</li>
<li>Replaced the OWASP HTML Sanitizer in Sanitization.xif by the <a class="link-https" href="https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank">HtmlSanitizer NuGet package</a>.<br/>
The SanitizeHtml action has the following differences when compared with the previous version:<br/>
— The <tt>&lt;noscript&gt;</tt> HTML tag is no longer allowed<br/>
— Some HTML attributes are no longer allowed: <tt>onfocus</tt>, <tt>onblur</tt>, <tt>onclick</tt>, <tt>onmousedown</tt>, <tt>onmouseup</tt>, <tt>noresize</tt>, <tt>background</tt><br/>
— The <tt>style</tt> attribute is now accepted (check the <a class="link-https" href="https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer#css-properties-allowed-by-default" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank">list of CSS attributes allowed by default</a>)<br/>
— The sanitization of attribute values is less restrictive, with no security implications (e.g. the <tt>color</tt> attribute now accepts a wider range of different values)<br/>
— There might be some slight differences in the sanitized output, with no security implications (e.g. the new sanitizer replaces <tt>&lt;br/&gt;</tt> elements with <tt>&lt;br&gt;</tt>)<br/>
— The new sanitizer does not add a <tt>nofollow</tt> attribute to anchor elements (RRCT-2161)</li>
<li>Updated the following JavaScript libraries used by the mobile application runtime: 'decimal.js' to version 10.0.1, 'toformat' to version 2.0.0. (RTAF-91)</li>
<li>Implemented several optimizations that reduced the load time of "List Modules" and "Solution Details" pages in Service Center. (RSCT-1852)</li>
<li>On a first install, ServiceCenter will now be deployed into a dedicated application pool in IIS named "ServiceCenterAppPool". On upgrade, if ServiceCenter exists in "OutSystemsApplications" application pool in IIS, ServiceCenter will be moved to a dedicated application pool named "ServiceCenterAppPool". If ServiceCenter is already in some other application pool, it will not be moved. (RSAT-1338)</li>
<li>Added to FactoryConfiguration the option to include X-Content-Type-Options header with nosniff as a method of preventing MIME sniffing from older browser versions. (RRCT-2270)</li>
<li>Service Center now links to the detach process documentation instead of launching the No Lock-in tutorial. (RICT-1199)</li>
</ul>
