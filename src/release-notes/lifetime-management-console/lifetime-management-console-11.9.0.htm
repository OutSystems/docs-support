<li>Removed the old environment registration experience. (RLIT-4348)</li>
<li>Added the ability to search by applications on the deployment plans screen. Also, improved the experience by separating the advanced filters. Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/10076/search-for-application-on-deployment-plans-of-lifetime">Rebecca Hall's idea</a>. (RLIT-4446)</li>
<li>You can now use the Maintenance Mode feature to set an environment into a special state that will prevent connections between LifeTime and that specific environment. (RLIT-4562)</li>
