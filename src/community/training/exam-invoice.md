# Learn how to get your certification or specialization exam receipt

OutSystems exams are delivered and monitored by a third-party service provider, Prometric. This means that the payment is done via Prometric, so for candidates to get access to a receipt  of their exams’ payment, they just need to follow the next steps:

1. Access [this page](https://proscheduler.prometric.com/);
1. Enter the exam’s confirmation number and the first 4 digits of the last name - Submit;
1. Click on the **Expand View** option where it says **full Confirmation/Receipt/Summary**;
1. Click on the **Receipt** button to receive by email.

Prometric is an United States vendor and therefore, has no tax or legal demands for invoicing. 

**As the OutSystems exams are purchased via Prometric, an invoice is not issued. What candidates have access to the purchase of an exam, is a receipt of payment, which contains the following information:**

* Product purchased, in this case, type exam
* Price of exam
* Name of the candidate
* Payment method used

Issuing the invoice is the responsibility of the service provider (Prometric), an entity in the United States. Entities that don't belong to the European Union aren't required to issue an invoice with the taxpayer number.

The receipts are issued by the service provider, therefore candidates have a document to support the expense/transaction (the receipt). The legislation doesn't make the acceptance of cost, by exam candidates’ companies, dependent on the taxpayer number, as stated in the article 23º nº 4 b) CIRC:

"Tax identification numbers of the supplier of goods or service provider and the acquirer or recipient, whenever they're entities with residence or permanent establishment in the national territory."

In Portugal, the receipt provided by Prometric can, and should, be accepted because in Portuguese fiscal law requirements are for national entities only (residence or permanent establishment).
