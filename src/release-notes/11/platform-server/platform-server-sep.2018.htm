<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Added a new application and module type (Services) to promote a better application segmentation and governance. (ABE-1276)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Added a new language element (Service Action) which is a loosely coupled action (REST underneath) with impact analysis and security by default. (ABE-1277)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Optional parameters and attributes do not require refreshing consumers, making larger systems more loosely coupled and allowing independent teams to release more often without impacting each other. (ABE-1278)</li>
<li dir="ltr">Public Screens are now loosely coupled, avoiding circular references in dependency analysis. (ABE-1279)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Containers_Release_Sep.2018">Containers</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">It's now possible to deploy and run OutSystems applications using Windows Docker Container in an on-premise Docker container environment, or in a cloud environment like Amazon (in Elastic Container Service) or Azure (in Azure Container Service). (RSAT-505)</li>
<li dir="ltr">The concept of Zones was revamped and it's now called Deployment Zones and have them associated to a hosting technology when application will be deployed. (RSAT-612)</li>
<li dir="ltr">A set of tools is now available to collect information about the Docker container and application health in order to help the troubleshoot or gather relevant information to the analysis.

</ul>
<h4 id="Logging_Release_Sep.2018">Logging</h4>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">It's now possible to store logs in a separate database from the one storing the data used by business applications and the data that supports the platform runtime (thanks to <a class="link-https" href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/132/Log+database+catalog" rel="external noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Didier Miller for highlighting this need as an idea</u></a>).

</ul>
<h3 id="Known_Issues_Release_Sep.2018">Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
In some situations, the new SOAP implementation in OutSystems 11 incorrectly serializes input parameters of Date, Time and DateTime data types for consumed Web Services, which might cause data corruption (namely losing time offsets for Time and DateTime data types) when sending values of these data types. This new implementation is used for all consumed SOAP Web Service elements created in version 11.

The previous behavior (in OutSystems 10) is the following:<br/>
— Values of Time data type are sent without date information and with timezone information (offset).<br/>
— Values of DateTime data type are sent with timezone information (offset).<br/>
— Values of Date data type are sent without time information.

In OutSystems 11 up to version 11.0.128.0 the incorrect behavior is the following:<br/>
— Values of Time data type are sent with (unnecessary) date information and without timezone information (offset).<br/>
— Values of DateTime data type are sent without timezone information (offset).<br/>
— Values of Date data type are sent with (unnecessary) time information.

The incorrect behavior has been fixed in version 11.0.128.0 to match the OutSystems 10 behavior.
