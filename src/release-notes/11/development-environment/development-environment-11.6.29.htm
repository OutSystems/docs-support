<ul>
<li>The built-in Service Studio tutorial (Help &gt; Build an App in 5 min) now shows how to use the <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Developing_an_Application/Implement_Application_Logic/AI-assisted_development">suggestions by the AI-assisted development feature</a>. (RAID-484)</li>
<li>Forge accesses from within Service Studio are authenticated automatically for users connected to their Personal Environments. This will not work if the user's environment credentials are different from the ones they use to access the community site. Inspired b <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/5611/">Jitendra Yadav's idea</a>. (RDEV-1347)</li>
<li>We improved the Data Replacement feature. You can now drag local Entities to Flows to scaffold Screens in Mobile Apps. Also, dragging a different Entity to an existing List, Table or Form Widget now produces better results, with less TrueChange errors. (RTAF-1991)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_11.6.29">Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solved an issue that prevented "remember me" Forge login option from working after restarting Service Studio. (RDEV-1360)</li>
<li>We fix an issue that occurs when someone tries to import a swagger 2.0 definition from a local file and without the schema property defined (RSBO-1180)</li>
</ul>
