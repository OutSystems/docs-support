# Personal environment hosting infrastructure under the hood

A Personal Environment is an OutSystems platform running on a multi-tenant, shared infrastructure.

Regardless of the (ever changing) underlying hardware, each personal environment has the following limitations:

* Multi-tenant shared infrastructure where the available resources (CPU, memory, IO) are limited by usage thresholds per environment

* Maximum of 2 GB for database storage of system and application data

* No caching is available

* No support for team collaboration

* Application versions are automatically deleted after two weeks

## Extracting your data

In a personal environment, you can't directly access the front-end or database servers. This ensures you have the best possible experience.

If you want to extract your data, you can:

* [Expose a REST API ](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Extensibility_and_Integration/REST/Expose_REST_APIs/Expose_a_REST_API) that makes your data available

* Implement functionality that allows [downloading an Excel file](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/How-to_Guides/Data/How_to_Export_Entity_Data_to_Excel) with the data
