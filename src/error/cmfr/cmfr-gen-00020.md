## Error message

`Both statuses must belong to the same Case Definition.`

## Cause

While trying to create or update a case state machine, the Case Management framework detected that the **CaseStatusId** and **NextCaseStatusId** attributes match case statuses that belong to different case definitions.

## Impact

The Case Management framework wasn't able to successfully execute the action.

## Recommended action

Make sure that the case status identifiers sent in the **CaseStatusId** and **NextCaseStatusId** attributes reference statuses that belong to the same case definition.
