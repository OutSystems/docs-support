# How to use an exam voucher to register for an exam

## Exam voucher

An exam voucher is a promotional code that can be used on the OutSystems Certifications Page to get a specific discount.

A candidate that has access to the voucher can use it to register for the desired exam, and insert the code on the last screen of the registration, on a box that says **Promotional Code or Voucher ID**.

## Voucher expiration date

Each voucher has an expiration date. When an exam candidate has access to this voucher, they should also have access to its expiration date-
This is the date on which the following steps have to be completed for an exam candidate to use the voucher to perform an exam:

1. Register on the OutSystems Certification page and schedule a date for the exam
1. Perform the exam

Take note of the 2nd point above, this means that the vouch cannot be used to schedule an exam after its expiration date. Example: If you have a voucher with an expiration date of March 31st, you can schedule the exam before that date, but you cannot schedule it for April 1st.

We strongly recommend candidates, whenever they have a voucher, to plan their calendar and use the voucher to schedule the exams right away, even if they don’t intend to take their exams soon. This will prevent candidates from using the voucher too close to the voucher’s expiration date, potentially not finding available slots to schedule their exams, and as a consequence, missing the opportunity of taking the exam with the discounted voucher.

## Invalid voucher

There are some situations in which, when inserting the voucher, users can see the error message saying “Invalid voucher”. This means that the voucher is no longer available to use, due to the following reasons:
* The candidate is trying to use the voucher to schedule the exam for a date that is after the expiration date
* The candidate is trying to use the voucher for an exam type that is not covered by that voucher 
* The candidate has already used the voucher for a previously scheduled exam 

Look out for these points, as in case you receive this message, you can understand why they are happening.
