<h1>Error executing query due to permission denied</h1>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>Error Code: OS-BERT-60407</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Symptoms</strong>: 42501: permission denied for schema runtime, Error in advanced query, OS-BERT-60407</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>When executing an <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/building_apps/data_management/fetch_data_from_the_database_in_outsystems/query_data_using_sql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">advanced SQL Query</a>, you may notice that you receive an error similar to the one below</p>
<pre id="isPasted">
    <code>OS-BERT-60407 - Error in advanced query (.....)<br/>42501: 42501: permission denied for schema runtime<br/>
    <br/>POSITION: 14</code>
</pre>
<p>Here's a concrete example:</p>
<p>

![Screenshot showing the error message OS-BERT-60407 with position 14 in an advanced SQL query.](images/im-image-ck-2025418xzkdq57A82NOM36g4PHo9mHaUpdiJGu00lbUA45Rg9.png "SQL Query Error Message")

</p>
<p>The "Position" is the character in the query where the error was triggered. It may be a different number than 14.</p>
<p>Once you know the position, open the Trace associated with the log and highlight the SQL Query so you can copy it.</p>
<p>Once you confirm the position of the error, you may determine that it is the position immediately after a specific command. In the example below, position 14 matches "CREATE TABLE":</p>
<p>

![Screenshot highlighting the SQL statement 'CREATE TABLE Test ()' causing the error at position 14.](images/im-image-ck-20254185vNNuaBpFQ3JooNl8H0qi2NdRmZ6xru879gYmQSMe0.png "SQL Query Error Position")

</p>
<p> Once you've confirmed the command that caused the error from its position, proceed to Incident Resolution Measure.</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>
<p>If you are getting this error, it is likely that the command itself is not permitted. The runtime user that executes these statements only has permissions for the statements listed below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>SELECT:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This command is used to retrieve data from one or more entities.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>INSERT:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This command is used to add new records in an entity.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>UPDATE:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This command is used to modify existing records in an entity.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>DELETE:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>This command is used to remove existing record data from an entity.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li data-sourcepos="10:5-11:0" style="box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);" id="isPasted">
        <span class="citation-4 recitation citation-end-4">TRUNCATE<strong>:</strong>
    </span>
    <ul>
        <li data-sourcepos="10:5-11:0">
            <span class="citation-4 recitation citation-end-4">This command is used to essentially clear an entity completely.</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other commands may result in the error above, so if you identify that your query is using a different command than the ones above and you're running into this error, than that is the cause. If you are running into this error and you identify that the position matches one of the five commands above, then this behavior is not expected, so please <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/support/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact our Global Support team</a>.</p>
