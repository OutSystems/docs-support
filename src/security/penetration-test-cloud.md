# Load and penetration tests on OutSystems Cloud

## Overview

As a subscription customer, you may wish to perform penetration tests, vulnerability scans or load tests. This is possible as long as they're limited to your own cloud infrastructure and under the **Customer** responsibility as described under the [OutSystems shared responsibility model](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Maintenance_and_Operations/OutSystems_Cloud_Shared_Responsibility_Model). To avoid having these tests blocked by OutSystems protection mechanisms, we request you to submit an inquiry.

## Performing scans in your OutSystems Cloud infrastructure

To perform penetration and load tests, and vulnerability scans, you must request authorization from OutSystems at least **5 business days** before the start date, for each test.

You'll need to [open a support case](https://www.outsystems.com/SupportPortal/CaseOpen/) and provide the following information:

1. **Contact Information** - Single point-of-contact managing the scans. Please provide:
    * Contact name
    * Phone number
    * Email address
2. **Scanning IP addresses (Source)** - The IP addresses that will scan the infrastructure.
3. **Environment(s)** - The environments' addresses or serial numbers
4. **Dates and time zone for the tests**:
    * Start date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM **UTC**)
    * End date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM **UTC**)

Please note that we require all the above-mentioned information (points 1. to 4.) to approve your request.

In case you need to alter your initial request, it takes an additional 2 business days to provide confirmation.
