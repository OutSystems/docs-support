<li>Fixed an issue that occurred when gathering module information from the probe and prevented some modules and applications being displayed on the canvas. (RADRT-1580)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused apps to not show up on the Architecture Dashboard canvas. The issue occurred with infrastructures using a timezone different from UTC+0. (RPM-1732)</li>
