# OS-MABS-CNF-40011

## Error message

`Couldn't generate your app because the {0} property of a resource declared in your extensibility configurations points to a restricted path. Check the resources in your extensibility configurations and retry.`

## Cause

This error occurs when a resource defined in extensibility configurations' `resources` has its `src` or `target` properties pointing to a restricted path.

The values of `src` and `target` properties are paths relative to Cordova's project root folder and platform project root folder, respectively. The resolved path must always be within them.

## Impact

The application package can't be generated.

## Recommended action

Check the extensibility configurations of your app and its dependencies to ensure that each of the resources declared in the extensibility configurations meets the requirements.
