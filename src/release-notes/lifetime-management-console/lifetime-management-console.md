<li>Improved OIDC configuration flow by forcing the logout of the current logged-in session after activating the provider. This ensures that the user logs in immediately with OIDC credentials. (RDOI-205)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_lifetime_management_console_11.16.2" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused OIDC and Legacy Authentication Providers (AD and LDAP) to be shown simultaneously as Active. This was a purely visual bug - only one provider was active at any given time. This occurred when switching from OIDC to a Legacy Provider or vice versa (RDOI-202)</li>

<li>Now when adding applications to a deployment plan, a warning icon is displayed to let the user know that the default staging option suggested by LifeTime has a different tag from the one currently published in the source environment. (RPM-947) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span> </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_lifetime_management_console_11.16.1" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a solution publish operation issue where more than one publish request was triggered to the target environment when a timeout occurred in the publish process. (RPM-1525) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the suspension of the synchronization process of the environments which would lead to problems when executing subsequent operations such as deployments, and setting configurations, among others.
This occurred in infrastructures with multiple applications that weren't deployed in every environment. The suspension was due to too many requests inside the process.
The issue was fixed in an internal query that will avoid the excessive number of requests that led to the suspension. (RPM-2117) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue which prevented a user with 'Change and Deploy' permissions over an environment to access the 'Settings' link in the Application_Details of an application from that environment. (RPM-2210) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issued that caused MoveData_RequestFact stored procedure to fail on Oracle.
This occurred when old LifeTimeAnalytics tables don't exist, the process was related to an old data migration process that is now removed. (RPM-2869) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused the user to be unable to register new environments in LifeTime due to lack of permissions. (RPM-3072) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Added new the auditing logs when the environment security settings are changed. Now each setting has a dedicated audit message indicating what has changed. (RPM-3205) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue with wrong audit message. In a cloud infrastructure, when changing the Maintenance Window of an environment the logged message had the wrong environment name and the user who made the request wasn't recorded. (RPM-3207) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed the issue that was causing the Username claim field to display default value always even when it was changed and saved. (RPM-3458) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that was not letting to enable legacy provider with Built-in authentication activated and throwing error. (RPM-3471) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an error when a user had Access permissions in the environment but Change&amp;Deploy in a specific Application.<br/>
This occurred when LifeTime would add a dependency of that app that the user has no permission to deploy.<br/>
Now, the user will get an exception saying that he does not have permission to deploy one or more of the added dependencies. (RPM-672) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Made the automatic abort due to errors on deployment plans more resilient.
In some situations, when an abort due to errors occurs in a deployment plan, it can end in an inconsistent state that can prevent other deployment plans to be created.
Now, even if the activity with error is skipped, the staging will be correctly marked as finished. (RPM-829) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a security issue that could allow access to server information. CVSSv3.1 score 6.3 (Medium). (RPM-3142) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>When clicking Save at the Environment Security page in Service Center (Administration > Security), a warning to "Save and Apply Settings to the Factory" may wrongly appear.  For example, if you have only changed the "Enhanced security for Remoting requests", the message to "Save and Apply Settings to the Factory" may appear but it's not necessary to apply settings.
This will happen when the default values for  Secure and SameSite Cookies are used.</li>
<li>For the IT Users authentication, if any Legacy provider (LDAP, AD, or any custom authentication provider) is already active and then an OpenId Connect Provider is activated (or vice-versa), LifeTime displays both the Legacy provider and the OpenId Connect provider as active. Said that, the authentication works properly with whichever provider is activated last. Though there is no impact on the functionality, visually this might be confusing to identify the active provider.
To avoid this situation, if either the Legacy provider or the OpenId Connect provider is active and the other one is to be activated, activating Built-in authentication first will have all the previous activation disabled and then the intended provider then can be activated without any visual issue.
If the issue is hit, the workaround is to activate the Built-in authentication and then activating back the OpenId Connect provider or the Legacy provider, whichever is intended.</li>
<li>While navigating between the OpenId Connect provider and the Legacy provider (LDAP, AD, or any custom authentication provider) tabs, the information section does not update accordingly in the right panel. Doing a browser refresh or selecting Built-in authentication tab before selecting any of the other provider tabs resolves this issue.</li>

<h3 id="new_in_lifetime_management_console_11.16.0" >New in LifeTime Management Console 11.16.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>The new IT Users Integration with External IdP OpenId Connect (OIDC) feature provides modern security standards for the authentication, setup, and management of IT users. This new authentication mechanism reduces the risk associated with using unsecured passwords when accessing OutSystems consoles and tools and eliminates the need for IT Users having to remember various passwords for multiple systems. Additionally, it improves the authentication experience by providing a single sign-on (SSO) authentication method. To learn more about this new authentication mechanism, see our <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Managing_the_Applications_Lifecycle/Secure_the_Applications/IT_Users_Integration_with_External_IdP_via_OpenId_Connect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>.</li>
<li>Authentication Settings, previously known as Authentication Mode, was extended to include OpenId Connect integration, new experience and integration requires Platform Server 11.18.0 in all registered environments.</li>
<li>Authentication Settings now support configuration of local administrators to be used in recovery scenarios when login with external authentication becomes broken. Requires Platform Server 11.18.0 in all registered environments.</li>
<li>New service account tokens now have expiration date and can be used on the Performance Monitoring API for all the environments registered in the LifeTime where they were issued. Old ones will keep working until they are re-issued.</li>
<li>LifeTime Services API (<a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_APIs/LifeTime_Services_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a>) has been deprecated and from this version (LifeTime 11.16.0) onwards, will no longer be supported. <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_APIs/LifeTime_API_v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LifeTime API v2</a> should be used instead. LifeTime Services API will be removed from the product by the end of March 2023.</li>
<br/>
<li>You can now use the Environment Filters feature to filter your Application Details with the Environments you are working on. (R11CT-1632)</li>
<li>Updated the Platform Server version to 11.18.0. (R11CT-1638)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_lifetime_management_console_11.16.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue on synchronization that could delay the synchronization processes to start when running on Oracle database. (R11CT-1652)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue during a deployment plan validation when the application tag has been already used in previous aborted deployments. This issue occurred in deployment plans that contained applications set to be auto tagged and these applications (with the same tag values) had been already used in deployment plans that were aborted before the solution had been published in the target environment. (RPM-3094) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in LifeTime. CVSSv3.1 score 5.4 (Medium). (RPM-3011) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>

<h3>Breaking Change</h3>
<ul>
<li>Breaking change on validating O10 staging plans: when validating a staging plan between O10 environments, if an attribute was removed from a static entity, the validation done by LifeTime will not detect it as a broken reference. To avoid errors, all modules that consume the changed reference should be refreshed and included in the staging.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>When applying the new security setting, described in the above mentioned security bulletin, it is necessary to perform an extra "Save" operation in Service Center Administration > Environment Configuration to ensure it is correctly set. This operation must be made on each environment after the setting is enabled.</li>
<li>LifeTime may display a feedback message instructing that it is necessary to "Apply them using a solution containing all modules". This is not necessary and can be skipped.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="breaking_changes_release_sep.2018">Breaking Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>LifeTime is now only supported when installed in a dedicated environment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> LifeTime now has its own release cycle to allow for better and faster improvements in LifeTime. To achieve this, LifeTime must be run, installed and maintained in a separate environment from the development pipeline environments in customer infrastructures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>LifeTime Analytics now has a historical data retention policy. This means that, by default, LifeTime Analytics will start deleting data older than 365 days.
<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> To optimize the performance of LifeTime Analytics, OutSystems introduced a mechanism to limit the amount of data kept by Analytics in the database. This was achieved by including a clean-up process that deletes data older than N days.</li>
<li><strong>Workaround:</strong> This policy can be removed by setting the <code>LifeTime.Analytics.DataRetentionPeriod</code> parameter to <code>0</code> in the OSSYS_PARAMETER table after the upgrade and before timers are switched on. Disabling data retention policy is not recommended and can cause performance degradation in Lifetime Analytics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Frontend Name used in Performance Monitor no longer follows the configuration defined in Service Center; it will always be the Machine Name in uppercase.
<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> This change was made to improve information consistency across other monitoring and log sources. It also became a required change with the introduction of containers support, since the platform no longer has control over what servers have which applications running and applications do not depend on the servers they are running on.</li>
<li><strong>Workaround:</strong> This information is not used by any of the built-in analytics components. Any custom modules using analytics information that might be using the Frontend Name may need to be adapted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The configuration parameter <code>LifeTime.AddApplicationsExplicitly</code>, along with the previous deployment planning implementation in LifeTime which used this parameter, were removed. From now on, LifeTime only supports the new deployment planning functionality.
<ul>
<li><strong>Rationale:</strong> The new deployment planning functionality is mature and has been widely adopted. As such, the previous deployment planning implementation in LifeTime is no longer available and the configuration parameter <code>LifeTime.AddApplicationsExplicitly</code> is no longer needed.</li>
</ul>
