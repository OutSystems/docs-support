<h1>Error encountered when deploying using a user with username containing the plus character</h1>

<strong>Symptoms</strong>: There was an error preparing settings due to a connection issue with target environment, 400 Bad Request, error validating user with grant delegation, 400 Bad Request on Server_API_IdentityServer.GetToken

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<strong>Symptoms:</strong>

When doing deployment through LifeTime using an IT User account with a username containing the '+' character, there will be an error:

<code>There was an error preparing settings due to a connection issue with target environment</code>

![Error preparing settings due to a connection issue with target environment.](images/im-image-ck-20255222rT7X7n4VCxZ7Q7xE0u8eLng77WZnZu6ANXQMp4bTO.png "Connection Issue Error")

There are no errors in the source environment's Service Center.

In LifeTime's Service Center logs, we can see the following:

This indicates that the username 'User+name' is being validated as 'User name' (i.e. the '+' character is replaced with space ' ')

The issue only happens after the user clicks [Continue] during staging.

The affected user is able to create applications and deployment plans without any errors.

<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>

<strong>Long-term solution</strong>

Check release notes whether there are any releases containing a fix for RPM-5879.

<strong>Workaround:</strong>

Deploy using a user without the '+' character in the username

Usernames without '+' do not have an issue. So, if feasible, remove the '+' from the username.
