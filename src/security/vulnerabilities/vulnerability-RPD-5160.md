OutSystems doesn't have any indication or reason to believe that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.

## Affected products

### Vulnerability details

One of the OutSystems services contained a path traversal vulnerability that would allow a developer to write arbitrary files to a location where the files could be executed. Since services run with high privileges, this could potentially lead to fully compromising the host and gaining access to any file or key present on the filesystem.

## Fixed products and versions

* For OutSystems Cloud infrastructures, OutSystems notified all its cloud customers and applied a no-downtime hotfix targeted at the specific version of each customer. The hotfix didn't require an update of the Platform Server version.

* For self-managed, you should upgrade to one of the following releases (or subsequent release);

    * Platform Server: 10.0.1102.0 and 11.9.0
