### Vulnerability details

This vulnerability resides in the way Service Studio manages the file system. By exploiting this vulnerability, a low privileged operating system user could re-write a file in the system, to which he doesn't have access to. This assuming that Service Studio is afterwards ran by an administrator or any other user with privileges to write the target file.

### Components and stacks

This vulnerability affects all Service Studio 11 versions.

## Protecting your OutSystems installation

### OutSystems 10

OutSystems 10 wasn't affected.

### OutSystems 11

OutSystems issued release Development Environment 11.8.13 that addresses this vulnerability. All subsequent releases are protected. Customers who have yet to update Service Studio are strongly encouraged to do so.

This vulnerability doesn't affect Service Studio installed on the Platform Server and therefore, the only necessary action is for developers to update their own Development Environment to the latest release.

### Workaround

There is no workaround, we strongly advise you to update to the above mentioned versions.
