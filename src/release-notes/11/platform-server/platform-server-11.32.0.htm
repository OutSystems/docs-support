This is limited to Dropdowns with Options Content set to "Text Only" in Reactive and Mobile apps.

<h3 id="bug_fixing_platform_server_11.32.0" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed incorrect database version deprecation notice appearing in Configuration Tool and Database Connections when using a SQL Server 2014 and Azure SQL databases. (R11BRT-1456)</li>
<li>Fixed the filename of the exported log file from Service Center for the screen requests and traditional web request logs. Reported by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/profile/tw1mjitbcc/overview">Jo√£o Martins Pereira</a>. (R11CT-3395)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the error page where the default error message appeared on the first render instead of the custom-defined one. Now, when a custom error message is set, the default error message no longer appears initially. This applies to Mobile applications only. (RPM-4231) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Data Access and Manipulation</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the source code of an application from being downloaded correctly, using the LifeTime API /lifetimeapi/rest/v2/applications/{ApplicationKey}/versions/{VersionKey}/content/,  when the application includes an extension. (RPM-5136) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a concurrency issue that caused the publish of an application with processes that have Conditional Start(s) to fail with "The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "OSFRK_OSSYS_BPM_ACTIVITY_OSSYS_BPM_PROCESS_PROCESS_ID" while that same application is creating new processes.
This only occurred for OutSystems Platforms running SQL Server as the platform database. (RPM-5205) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Processes</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a security weakness related to Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine. (RPM-5239) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the tenant page in Service Center will present multi-tenant site properties from other tenants that share the same modules with tenant being viewed in a factory with more than 900 modules. (RPM-5257) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Server.API</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing serial number for EC2 machines using EC2 Launch v2 not being calculated correctly. It may be necessary to retrieve a new license for the correct serial after the upgrade. (RPM-5259) <span class="cattag">Infrastructure Management</span>  <span class="cattag">Licensing Infrastructure</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused modules not being able to be debugged when there were inconsistencies with the way key of Application was stored in system entities. (RPM-5271) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span>  <span class="cattag">Debugger</span> </li>
<li>Fixed a performance degradation issue on Service Center, affecting only frontends that aren't the Controller. The performance degradation affected specially the Home, Module List and Solution Edit pages and was proportional to the number of modules in the environment. (RPM-5298) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">Service Center</span> </li>
<li>Removed dependency to Portable.BouncyCastle that was being introduced by MySql, due to the driver upgrade. This fixes several security vulnerabilities reported in this dependency. CVSSv3.1 score 5.9 (Medium) Customers using custom extensions that rely on Portable.BouncyCastle (BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll) may still be affected. (RPM-5178) <span class="cattag">Application Runtime</span> </li>
