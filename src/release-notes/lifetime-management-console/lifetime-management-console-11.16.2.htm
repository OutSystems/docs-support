<ul>
<li>Improved OIDC configuration flow by forcing the logout of the current logged-in session after activating the provider. This ensures that the user logs in immediately with OIDC credentials. (RDOI-205)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_lifetime_management_console_11.16.2" >Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused OIDC and Legacy Authentication Providers (AD and LDAP) to be shown simultaneously as Active. This was a purely visual bug - only one provider was active at any given time. This occurred when switching from OIDC to a Legacy Provider or vice versa (RDOI-202)</li>
</ul>
