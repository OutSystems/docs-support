# OS-MABS-GEN-40018

## Error message

`There was an issue generating the app. Whitelist Plugin was renamed AllowList in newer Cordova Android engine versions. Check your plugin code and try again.`

## Cause

This error occurs when you generate an Android package with MABS 8 or higher because, with Cordova Android version 10 and higher, the Whitelist plugin was renamed to AllowList, which broke all references to Whitelist-related classes.

## Impact

The Android application package can't be generated.

## Recommended action

Check the build logs on Service Center to identify the affected custom plugin and change `Whitelist` references for `Allowlist`.
