# OS-MABS-GEN-40008

## Error message

`There was an issue generating the app. Meta-data {0} is being defined more than once. Check the plugin documentation to ensure the setup is right.`

## Cause

Generating the Android application package failed because a custom plugin is overriding a metadata tag attribute in AndroidManifest.xml more than once.

## Impact

The Android application package can't be generated.

## Recommended action

Identify which custom plugins are overriding the metadata attribute more than once. Note that a metadata tag attribute can only be set once across the project.
