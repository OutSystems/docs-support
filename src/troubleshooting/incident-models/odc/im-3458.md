<h1>Unable to create external database connection - IP address is not allowed to access the server"</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>Error Code: OS-INTC-API-50004</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Errors related to External Database connections, Unable to create external database connection, Client is not allowed accessed to the server, OS-INTC-API-50004</p>

<h2>Precautions</h2>

<p>While the principles of this Incident Model apply to all External Connections, the error message used to illustrate this is specific to Azure SQL Databases in ODC.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>While attempting to connect to an External Database, you may run into the error below:</p>

<p>![Error message showing connection test failed for stage 'Development' due to IP address not allowed to access the server.](images/im-image-ck-2025327ljiJVfhPhvnH64VimOV99vQEqdZLGYB91dPJZ07P8P.png "Connection Test Failed Error")</p>

<p>The most important part of the error is the error details:</p>

<p>Details: Cannot open server 'database-server' requested by the login. Client with IP address '[IP]' is not allowed to access the server. To enable access, use the Azure Management Portal or run sp_set_firewall_rule on the master database to create a firewall rule for this IP address or address range. It may take up to five minutes for this change to take effect.</p>

<p>This error is most likely to occur instantly when you're trying to set up a connection.</p>

<p>In some situations, it's also possible that this occurs after you had already successfully configured a connection, and you'll only run into the error above after trying to refresh your Database's list of entities or even to view one of these Entities in ODC Studio, only to run into errors "OS-INTC-API-50004 - Couldn't retrieve list of entities" or "Object 'connection-id' not found" respectively:</p>

<p>![Error message indicating 'Couldn't retrieve the list of entities' with error code OS-INTC-API-50004.](images/im-image-ck-2025313vOwikTho1zi4c6MDof4WP5MGuFkWQcU4UzgG09qROU.png "Couldn't Retrieve List of Entities Error")</p>

<p>![Error message showing test query failed with error 'Object not found'.](images/im-image-ck-2025327CtJXGWgq5B84Ls46a1Du4SsVpDVuqn2iatBe3DFm75.png "Test Query Failed Error")</p>

<p>If you are running into these errors and, when testing the connection, you can confirm that you receive the message above about the IP Address not being allowed in the server, proceed to Incident Resolution Measures.</p>

<h2>Incident Resolution Measures</h2>

<p>As the error indicates, the cause of this is that the Azure SQL Database you are trying to connect to is blocking connections from that specific IP address, which likely matches your ODC Organization.</p>

<p>If your External Database requires IP allowlisting, then the connection will not be possible and this error occurs, we recommend that you <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/managing_outsystems_platform_and_apps/configure_a_private_gateway_to_your_network/" id="isPasted" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">use a private gateway</a> to create this connection; by doing it this way, you'll have full control of the IP address of your Cloud Connector server and you can use that IP address to build the connection to your External Database.</p>

<p>As a fallback option, you can also check our article <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/outsystems_developer_cloud/managing_outsystems_platform_and_apps/allowlisting_odc_public_ip_addresses/">Allowlisting ODC public IP addresses</a> to find the list of IPs that match your ODC's region, and whitelist those. That said, it is worth noting that all apps running on ODC, for all customers, in the same region and stage type will share these IPs. If this model doesn't meet your security requirements, you should use a Private Gateway.</p>

<p>OutSystems also tries to ensure that these IP addresses remain unchanged as much as possible, however, the list of public IPs may change over time due to infrastructure updates, though such changes are expected to be rare.</p>
