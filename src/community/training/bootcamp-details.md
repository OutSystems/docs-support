# What is the price of an OutSystems Boot Camp and how can you register

The OutSystems Boot Camps are a great way to learn since participants get to learn in a group, with a trainer on the spot and various hands-on exercises. This is a highly immersive way to learn OutSystems, and it's one of our **training paid offers**.

Users can enroll to participate in any of the Public Boot Camps available on the calendar, checking all of them on our [Boot Camp page](https://www.outsystems.com/training/classroom-training/), selecting according to their type, location (if onsite), or timezone (if remote).
