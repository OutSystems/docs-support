# OS-MABS-GEN-40013

## Error message

`There was an issue generating the app. Using “requireCordovaModule” to load non-cordova module {0} is not supported. Instead, add this module to your dependencies and use regular “require” to load it.`

## Cause

Generating the application package failed because “requireCordovaModule” can’t be used to load a non-cordova module.

## Impact

The application package can't be generated.

## Recommended action

Check the build logs on Service Center to confirm which custom plugin is using “requireCordovaModule” to load a non-cordova module; replace “requireCordovaModule” with “require” in the plugin.
