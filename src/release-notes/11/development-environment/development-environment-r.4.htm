<h3 id="new_in_development_environment_release_4">New in Development Environment Release 4</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed the "Choose template" step for the creation of Service Applications. (ABE-1203)</li>
<li>You can now create a Static Record, a Parameter or a Variable by pressing Ctrl+N when an element of the same type is selected, or by right-clicking on an existing element of the desired type. Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/4926/">Johan den Ouden's idea</a>. (ABE-1282)</li>
<li>We improved the tooltip that shows when you hover over the tree toggle button. It now says "Show Widget Tree" or "Show Elements Tree", depending on the action if performs. (ABE-1287)</li>
<li>The flow now reconnects whenever possible after you use the Disable Elements command to "comment out" parts of the flow. Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/5639/"> Eric Bulters' idea</a>. (RIUT-488)</li>
<li>If the text value of a property has several lines, there's now a multiline indicator in form of a downwards arrow in the Properties Pane. Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/3667/">Takeshi Kurimoto's idea</a>. (RIUT-466)</li>
<li>You can now save multiple items from the Resources to your computer. Select the elements you want to export in Data &gt; Resources, right-click and choose "Save Resources As…". Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/700/">Pedro Gonçalves' idea</a>. (RIUT-467)</li>
<li>Now labels in flow connectors are shown in the middle of the arrow. Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/5106/">João Pedro Bernardes' idea</a>. (RIUT-465)</li>
<li>We made the label for splitting of the Assign values more explicit, so now it says "Split all below into new Assign". Thanks for your continuous feedback! (RIUT-462)</li>
<li>Now publishing a module to a Production environment requires confirmation. Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/1709/">Justin James' idea</a>. (RIUT-420)</li>
<li>The User and Role exceptions are now sorted alphabetically. Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/5103/">Rebecca Hall's idea</a>. (RIUT-480)</li>
<li>Now there's a warning during an introspection of a WSDL, if it contains an attributeGroups element. (RINT-2759)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bug_fixing_release_4">Bug Fixing</h3>
<ul>
<li>We fixed a bug that prevented you from installing Charts or OutSystems Now from Forge in some situations, causing the message "Application cannot be safely installed in your environment" to show. (ABE-1289)</li>
<li>Fixed a user interface glitch that prevented the "Executed SQL" pane to shows when you run a query through the SQL tool in Service Studio connected to a non-production environment. (ABE-1297)</li>
<li>The Users application now shows the correct number of users with a role in an application. (RLIT-2274)</li>
<li>The label of the SQL tool under the output element now shows "Output Entity" or "Output Structure", depending on what you select in the pane. (ABE-1280)</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that happened after you used '@' within quotations in an SQL expression of the SQL tool. (ABE-1291)</li>

<li>Fixed a crash that happened occasionally after performing an operation (e.g. right-click) on the HTML Element widget that had a Tag property that did not support children (e.g. "input"). (RAFT-885)</li>
