<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused a strange behavior on the Environments page (cloud only) when using environment filters.
This occurred in/when using environment filters and the selected environment was not part of the active filter, when navigating to the Environments page, no environment was selected causing a strange behavior.
Now, the first environment in the filter will be selected. (R11CT-4337)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the environments would not show in the Infrastructure screen. Now all the environments visible to the user are displayed correctly. (RPM-6128) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused sections of the Environments page to not appear in OutSystems Cloud infrastructures.
Now, all the sections should appear, when active for that environment and/or infrastructure. (RPM-6216) <span class="cattag">Application Lifecycle</span>  <span class="cattag">LifeTime</span> </li>
