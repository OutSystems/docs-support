<ul>
<li>Service Studio will now require installation of .NET 4.7.2 (as stated in System Requirements). (RICT-2083)</li>
<li>You can now translate the UI of your Reactive Web Apps and Mobile Apps directly inside Service Studio. Multilingual is a technical preview feature and you need to activate the option "Multilingual for Mobile and Reactive" in LifeTime. After enabling the feature, use the new Multilingual Locales folder and new SetCurrentLocale system client action. (RTAF-3387)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Service Studio to crash while opening modules that contain expressions that rely on implicit conversions between different data types. (RICT-2859)</li>
<li>When importing a REST Web Service through a Swagger specification, it is now possible to choose what methods to import. Inspired by <a href="https://www.outsystems.com/ideas/4849/rest-consume-all-select-which-methods">Kilian Hekhuis's idea</a>.</li>

<li>Addressed a discrepancy in the documented behavior of ExcelToRecordList when the SheetName parameter is left empty. Now it correctly indicates that the method will attempt to import a sheet called "Sheet1" and only if that is not available will it import the first sheet of the document. (RDEV-2311)</li>
