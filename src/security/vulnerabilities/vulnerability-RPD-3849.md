### Vulnerability details

This vulnerability is in the ECT Provider component. An unauthenticated attacker could use the endpoint provided by this component to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which could then execute when an ECT Provider user accesses the ECT Provider back-office in the App Feedback application via a web browser. In some cases, the injected code runs with high privileges on the OutSystems platform.

## Protecting your OutSystems Platform
### OutSystems Cloud

OutSystems notified cloud customers and updated or applied a patch to all affected cloud infrastructures.

The environments were patched without the need for a platform server version update. 

### On-Premises Installations

OutSystems issued new releases of the Platform Server that address this vulnerability.
All customers who have yet to update their Platform servers are strongly encouraged to do so.

#### OutSystems 10

This vulnerability is fixed for Platform Server version 10.0.1005.2 and all subsequent versions.


#### OutSystems 11

The vulnerability is fixed for Platform Server version Release Jan.2019 CP2 and all subsequent versions.


### Workaround

A Platform Server upgrade is strongly advised. If you do not have the opportunity to upgrade your on-premises Platform, we advise you to disable the ECT Provider component for all eSpaces.

OutSystems PaaS infrastructures do not require any workaround as they were all patched and are protected.
