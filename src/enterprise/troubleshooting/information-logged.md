# Information Logged by OutSystems Platform

OutSystems Platform components and services use the Windows logging mechanisms to log entries about their status and operations status.

## Logged Entries

### Looking Up the Logged Entries

The logged entries generated by the OutSystems Platform components can be viewed using the Windows Event Viewer. To access it, simply open the Windows Start menu and under the ‘Settings’ entry chose the ‘Control Panel’ option. Then, doubleclick on the ‘Administrative Tools’ item and double-click again on the ‘Event Viewer’ item. The Event Viewer window will be displayed:

Click on the ‘Application’ folder to see the logged entries of the OutSystems Platform.

### Types of Logged Entries

The log entries can be classified in one of three types:errors,warnings andinformation.  Anerror corresponds to a malfunction of the application or service that eventually might need a user action to fix it.  A warning doesn’t have the gravity of an error but you should investigate what is happening because it might originate future errors. Finally, the information type is used solely to inform the user of some fact but no user action should be needed.

### Log Sources

The logged entry may be generated by one of the following sources:

* OutSystems Configuration Tool

* OutSystems Platform

* OutSystems Service Center Installer

* OutSystems Deployment Controller Service

* OutSystems Deployment Service

* OutSystems Log Service

* OutSystems Scheduler Service

* OutSystems SMS Connector Service

### Log Contents

The logged entry content depends on the OutSystems Platform’s component or service that generates it.

#### Common to All Components and Web Applications

There are logged entries that all the components of the OutSystems Platform can generate:

* Errors and warnings related to database connectivity problems

* Errors related to the configuration of the message queue logging mechanism.

#### OutSystems Applications

Information about configuration of **performance counters** and **synchronous/asynchronous logging** can be logged when OutSystems generated applications are being initialized.

#### OutSystems Services

Information about configuration of **performance counters** and **synchronous/asynchronous logging** can be logged when OutSystems generated services are being initialized.

#### OutSystems Log Service

OutSystems Log Service can, in particular, log some additional information, namely about:

* Bulk logging insert errors;

* Generic database errors;

* Miss-configured messages warnings.

#### Configuration Tool

This OutSystems Platform component logs entries for all OutSystems schema database upgrade errors.

### Examples

Following are some examples of log entries for errors, warnings and information.
