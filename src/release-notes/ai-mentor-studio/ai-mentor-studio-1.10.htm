<ul>
<li>Improved the "Avoid Anonymous and/or Registered access Screens" pattern by reducing the number of false positives. The pattern now ignores anonymous screens created by default ("Login", "InternalError", "InvalidPermissions", and "NoPermissions").</li>
<li>Now, the "Missing description on public element" pattern ignores attributes of entities and structures that don't have descriptions.</li>
<li>Now, the "Unlimited Records in Aggregate" pattern ignores aggregates with a single source filtered by entity primary key without "Max. Records" defined.</li>
<li>Removed the "Not checking if the mobile device is compromised" pattern.</li>
<li>Removed the "Image widgets without width" pattern.</li>
<li>Removed the "Prefix Timer actions" pattern.</li>
<li>Improved the message that tells you when the last synchronization occurred and when the next one should occur. Now, you'll also see a warning if the last synchronization occurred more than 12 hours ago.</li>
