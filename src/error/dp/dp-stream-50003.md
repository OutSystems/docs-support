# OS-DP-STREAM-50003

## Error message

`There was an unknown error reaching your APM tool server. If the problem persists, contact OutSystems Support.`

## Cause

An unknown error occurred while connecting your APM tool server.

## Impact

Unable to establish a connection with the destination server since the server is unreachable or has encountered unexpected conditions. Therefore, logs are not streamed to the destination/APM tool.

## Recommended action

The destination server has responded with an **HTTP 503** error. Therefore, check if the APM tool works correctly and re-establish the connection.
