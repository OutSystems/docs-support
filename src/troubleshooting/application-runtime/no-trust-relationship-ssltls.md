# Could not establish trust relationship when consuming web services in OutSystems

## Symptoms

When **consuming** a web service, you're getting the following error:

`Server was unable to process request. ---> The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel.`

<div class="info" markdown="1">

OutSystems servers must have a valid SSL certificate issued by a public Certificate Authority, as described in [OutSystems system requirements](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setting_Up_OutSystems/OutSystems_system_requirements).
If you encounter this error while **exposing** a web service, make sure that your OutSystems servers have that type of certificate.
</div>

## Cause

This is caused by an invalid or untrusted certificate on the server that exposes the web service you're trying to consume.

It happens often when integrating in non-productive environments, since the certificates installed on those web servers are usually self-signed.

### Identify the cause

* Navigate to the service URL using a browser, and check for certificate errors. The error message displayed by the browser will help you troubleshoot what's causing the error. If you don't see any certificate error on your local browser, repeat the test using a browser installed on the server with the problem.

    The following example shows an invalid certificate:

* Click on **Certificate** to see the details.

    The following example shows a certificate that is invalid because it expired:

## Resolution

The resolution depends on the what's causing the SSL certificate validation to fail. The most common reasons and their resolutions are:

| Cause | Resolution |
|:------|:-----------|
| The hostname used in the URL doesn't match the name that's on certificate. | Make sure the URL you're using and the URL on the **Issued to** field of the certificate are the same. |
| The certificate is not accepted. |To understand if a certificate is no longer valid or has expired, you can use either SSL Checker, or SSL Install to check your certificate. If the server is not accessible over internet, you can validate a certificate from within the client machine by running the following command on the command line interface: ``openssl s_client -connect <server_host>:443``. |
| The Certificate Root Authority that issued the certificate is not trusted by the server. | Make sure to add the certificate to the trusted store on OutSystems servers. Check the instructions:<ul><li>[For OutSystems cloud](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Maintenance_and_Operations/Add_certificate_to_trusted_root_store_in_OutSystems_cloud).</li><li>[For self managed environments](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Installation/Add_self_signed_certificate_to_trusted_root_store_on_OutSystems).</li></ul> |
| The certificate is self-signed. | Make sure to install the certificate as trusted. Check the instructions:<ul><li>[For OutSystems cloud](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Maintenance_and_Operations/Add_certificate_to_trusted_root_store_in_OutSystems_cloud).</li><li>[For self managed environments](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Enterprise_Customers/Installation/Add_self_signed_certificate_to_trusted_root_store_on_OutSystems).</li></ul> |
|Protocol and ciphers mismatch| The server and client might not be able to communicate if the two donâ€™t share the same protocols and at least one Cipher Suite per protocol. If the server and client machines are accessible over the internet, you can use online tools like SSL Labs to check protocols and ciphers for each endpoint. If they aren't accessible from the internet, go to the command line interface inside one of the machines (either client or server side) and execute the following command for each endpoint: ``nmap -sV --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 <host>``|
