<ul>
<li>This LifeTime version suffers from poor access times when users navigate to staging related pages (e.g. Staging_Edit, Staging_Summary and Staging_Progress). This issue has been fully addressed from LifeTime version 11.11.0 onwards. The performance degradation is more notable when a large number of applications are staged.
