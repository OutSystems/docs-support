# Application deployment takes too long after adding a new Entity Attribute

## Symptoms

After adding a new [Entity Attribute](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_Language/Data/Modeling_Data/Entity_Attribute) to an existing [Entity](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Reference/OutSystems_Language/Data/Modeling_Data/Entity), deploying the new application version takes a long time or times out during the update database phase.

This scenario occurs when you add a new Attribute to an Entity that already has millions of records.

The following use cases can also lead to this scenario:

* Converting an Entity to multi-tenant (which results in adding a new Attribute to the Entity)
* Adding a unique constraint over an existing Entity Attribute

## Cause

In environments with Platform Server 11.11.0 or earlier, the step to update the database model during deployment runs a DML (Data Manipulation Language) statement to set the new database columnâ€™s default value. As this statement runs over the whole table, it times out on the database side for tables with millions of records.

## Solution

For SQL Server Enterprise and Oracle databases, upgrade the environment to [Platform Server 11.11.1](https://success.outsystems.com/Support/Release_Notes/11/Platform_Server#Platform_Server_11.11.1), as this version provides a fix for this issue.

An alternative to upgrading is to increase the query timeout by running the Configuration Tool and changing the **Default Query Timeout** under the Platform Tab (applies only to self-managed environments).
