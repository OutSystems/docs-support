<ul>
<li>Fixed the position of the "Show value" button in the debugger variables (e.g. "In Use", "Locals"). (RMAC-10088)</li>
<li>Improved the message shown on Aggregates when all attributes are hidden so that is distinguishable from the cases where there are no records to shown. (RMAC-10381)</li>
<li>Removed unnecessary empty lines from the Tooltips shown on Assign nodes.  (RMAC-10639)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Merge editor that caused a crash during item selection if module versions had different links in a flow. (RMAC-10690)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused a module to be marked as changed when canceling a source rename in an aggregate. (RMAC-10718)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused new text to be created at the bottom of the screens when typing new text in placeholders. (RMAC-10738)</li>
<li>Fixed the source picker in the sort tab of grouped Aggregates to only allow picking grouped attributes. (RMAC-10753)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that cause the Service Studio to freeze when clicking in the Table Record widget toolbar options. (RMAC-10756)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented widgets placed inside a Tabs widget content to be dragged to another position. (RMAC-10762)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused Service Studio to freeze when changing the display mode of an If element. (RMAC-10766)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused an incorrect behavior when double clicking Placeholders in a Screen or Block.<br/>
The double click was not navigating to the Placeholder's parent Block and when typing after that, the text was being added in the bottom of the Screen.<br/>
Now, the double click correctly navigates to the Placeholder's parent Block. (RMAC-10775)</li>
</ul>
