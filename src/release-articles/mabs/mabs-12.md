## Breaking changes

Here's the list of breaking changes that apply to MABS 12 for building **Capacitor** apps.

* WebView version 102 or higher is required for mobile applications to run on Android devices. Ensure your WebView is up to date by visiting the Play Store.
* The Inspector is no longer available for iOS debug builds. If you need to inspect the network requests you can set one of the many interactive HTTPS proxies available.
* The `DeepLinksHandlerType` configuration no longer has any effect. Deeplinks are only customizable via the `window.handleOpenURL` function, which must be defined in a script that is loaded by the application module. If not defined, the application navigates to the deeplink URL by default.

## Known issues

Here's the list of known issues:

* Users cannot upload custom xcprivacymanifest for Capacitor apps  **(Capacitor only)**
* Updates over the air fail for apps that use build actions YAML file provided as OutSystems app resources **(Capacitor only)**
* Back navigation with back button or gesture navigation doesn't affect in-app navigation when running in Android 16 **(Capacitor only)**
* Edge to Edge is now mandatory for Android 16/API 36. Support is still limited.
