# Add a new environment to your infrastructure

To add a new environment to your infrastructure, first contact your sales representative to discuss the requirements for the new environment and the details about obtaining an additional license.

For Cloud customers OutSystems will process your order, set up the new environment, and notify you by email when the new environment is available for use. 

For self-managed installations:

1. Install and prepare the new environment. See [Setting Up OutSystems](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setup_and_maintain_your_OutSystems_infrastructure/Setting_Up_OutSystems) for more information.
1. Register the serial number, download, and install the license in your new environment. See [here](../enterprise/licensing/manage/get-license-for-env.md) the complete instructions.
1. Register the new environment in the management console, LifeTime. See [Configure the infrastructure management console](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Setup_and_maintain_your_OutSystems_infrastructure/Setting_Up_OutSystems/Configure_the_infrastructure_management_console) for more information.

Customers with a hybrid configuration (with some should environments in the OutSystems Cloud and others as self-managed) should contact [technical support](https://www.outsystems.com/legal/success/support-terms-and-service-level-agreements-sla-of-the-outsystems-software/#contact-channels) for instructions about how to add a new environment.

Hybrid configurations are supported only in OutSystems licenses purchased **before January 2020**.
