# OS-MABS-PREF-40002

## Error message

`Preference key <key> in <context> has a wrong type.`

## Cause

This error occurs when the application's extensibility configuration has key named **&lt;key&gt;** that is of the wrong type in the context **&lt;context&gt;**.

## Impact

Users can't generate the application package.

## Recommended action

Fix the application extensibility configuration by fixing the key value type and retry rebuilding your application.
