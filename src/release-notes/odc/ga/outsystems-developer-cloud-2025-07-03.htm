<li>We've launched a new suite of APIs for Organization Roles in ODC, providing you with tools to automate user and access management through organization roles. You can now programmatically create, retrieve, update, and delete organization roles, assign and revoke specific roles for users, and easily list all roles assigned to a user. Additionally, you can access detailed information about available permissions, offering even finer control over access rights. (RDPP-2579)</li>
