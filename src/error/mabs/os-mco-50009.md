# OS-MCO-50009

## Error message

`An error occurred while fetching package <Package>. If the problem persists, open a support case.`

## Cause

An internal error occurred.

## Impact

The mobile compilation fails, causing the native mobile build to fail.

## Recommended action

Check that you haven't modified the extensibility configurations of any supported OutSystems library or plugin.

Please try the operation again. This might be a temporary issue that resolves on its own.
