<ul>
<li>Weâ€™re introducing three new connectors at Data Fabric - Azure AI Search, AWS Kendra AI, and Custom AI Search - that enable developers to integrate AI-powered search services into their applications. These connectors allow applications to leverage intelligent search capabilities, improving information retrieval and enhancing user experiences with more relevant results. The Custom AI Search connector also allows developers to connect to other search services of their choice. (RDCIST-2661)</li>
<li>Workflow Editor: Parallel Paths
<ul>
<li>In the Workflow Editor, is now possible to add Parallel paths.</li>
<li>Adding a parallel is now an option in the menu to add flow steps.</li>
<li>Each parallel has by default two paths, but the user can add more paths to run simultaneously.</li>
<li>It's possible to create a maximum of two nested parallel flows within a parallel path.</li>
<li>The execution of an workflow automatically proceeds to the subsequent activity, once all the paths of a parallel are completed.</li>
</ul> (RDODCT-3166)</li>
