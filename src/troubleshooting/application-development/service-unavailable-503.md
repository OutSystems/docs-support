## Cause

If you are experiencing any of the symptoms above, then your personal environment **has been automatically disabled**. This happened because one of your applications has exceeded the allowed resource usage.

This protection mechanism disables Personal Environments if any of following occurs:

* Your application has at some point **reached the allowed memory limit** for your personal environment.

* You have created an application that was using **too much CPU for a long time**.

* You have created a pattern (an **infinite loop or wrong code pattern** in an integration) that is causing your environment to crash repeatedly.

* You have **too many complex applications running**.

## Resolution

Your Personal Environment can be recovered in the following ways:

* For symptoms 1 and 2, you get the following error in Service Studio:

    ![Notification dialog in Service Studio indicating the personal environment limit has been exceeded with an option to free up resources.](images/service-unavailable-503_4.png "Personal Environment Limit Exceeded Notification")

    Click **Free up the resources**. You are redirected to the following page. Click the _[Free Up Resources](https://www.outsystems.com/home/FreeUpResources.aspx)_ button.

    <div class="info" markdown="1">
    Keep in mind that if the same conditions apply, freeing up resources in the Personal Environment won't automatically stop it from reaching the resource limit again. So, make sure that you troubleshoot the applications that you were working on that might have triggered the temporary suspension of your environment.
