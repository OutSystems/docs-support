<li>The OutSystems Platform no longer reports that it is using JQuery-ui and JQuery-ui-dialog version 1.8.24. <br/>
OutSystems ships a custom fork of jQuery UI 1.8.24 with back-ported fixes for all known vulnerabilities. Previously, the platform reported this fork as version 1.8.24, which led to <a href="https://success.outsystems.com/support/security/penetration_testing/">false positives in security scans</a>.<br/>
If your application logic relies on detecting the 1.8.24 version string, it may no longer behave as expected. This is not a supported use case and should be avoided. (R11DT-3109)</li>
