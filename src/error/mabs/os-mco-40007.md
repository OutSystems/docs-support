# OS-MCO-40007

## Error message

`NPM identifier <Identifier> is not valid.`

## Cause

An NPM identifier in a plugin source within the extensibility configurations of your mobile app or its libraries isn't valid. This can occur if the identifier contains invalid characters, has an incorrect format, or fails to follow NPM naming conventions.

For example, using Universal Extensibility:

```json
{
  "buildConfigurations": {
    "capacitor": {
      "source": {
        "npm": "@capacitor/camera@not-a-valid-version"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Another example, using Cordova-based Extensibility:

```json
{
  "plugin": {
    "identifier": "some-plugin@invalid version"
  }
}
```

Alternatively, an OutSystems internal NPM identifier isn't valid.

## Impact

The mobile compilation fails, causing the native mobile build to fail.

## Recommended action

Find the invalid NPM identifier in the extensibility configurations of your mobile app or its libraries, and update it to a valid NPM identifier.

If the identifier is for an OutSystems internal package or the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-MCO-40007).
