# OS-MCO-40013

## Error message

`<AssetName> <AssetVersion> is not compatible with MABS <MabsVersion> <MobileFramework>. Update the asset to the latest version.`

## Cause

The library version you're using isn't compatible with your current MABS version or mobile framework. Some MABS versions or mobile frameworks require newer library versions to ensure compatibility of features or APIs.

## Impact

The mobile compilation fails, causing the native mobile build to fail.

## Recommended action

Update the asset mentioned in the error message to the latest version. Newer versions are more likely to be compatible with your current MABS version and mobile framework. OutSystems recommends keeping libraries up to date to benefit from the latest features, improvements, and security patches.

If you cannot update the asset to the latest version due to incompatibilities, then build your mobile app with an older MABS version or a different mobile framework.

If the problem persists, create a case with [OutSystems Support](https://www.outsystems.com/support/portal/open-support-case?ErrorCode=OS-MCO-40013).
